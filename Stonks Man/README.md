##Compilation Instructions:
There is already `stonks.exe` which is an executable that has been compiled to the latest version, but if you want to compile yourself, use:

`g++ stonks.cpp Game.cpp Player.cpp -o stonks`


and then run the program like any ordinary C++ program

##Commands in-game
The help menu will tell you everything you will need to know

You are a businessman who is trying to get lucky and become a millionaire by playing the stock market.
There are 4 actions you can take:
  1. Travel to a different city:
    - This lets you travel to any city on the map but it takes time and money to travel.
  2. View stocks:
    - This allows you to look at all the stocks on the market and see their prices, as well as a 5-day forecast on what the change in price could be.
  3. Buy/Sell stocks:
    - Lets you sell any stock you have for the specified price, but you can only buy certain stocks in certain cities.
  4. Wait:
    - The wait function lets you pass time in your current city, but you have to pay money for each day
The overall goal is to make $1,000,000 while starting out with a measly $10,000.
Have fun!
