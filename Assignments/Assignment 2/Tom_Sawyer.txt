the adventures of tom sawyer

by mark twain

preface

most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred one or two
were experiences of my own the rest those of boys who were schoolmates
of mine huck finn is drawn from life tom sawyer also but not from an
individual he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom
i knew and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture

the odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and
slaves in the west at the period of this story that is to say thirty or
forty years ago

although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
girls i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account
for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what
they once were themselves and of how they felt and thought and talked
and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in

no answer

tom

no answer

whats gone with that boy i wonder you tom

no answer

the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
room then she put them up and looked out under them she seldom or
never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy they were
her state pair the pride of her heart and were built for style not
service she could have seen through a pair of stove lids just as well
she looked perplexed for a moment and then said not fiercely but
still loud enough for the furniture to hear

well i lay if i get hold of you ill

she did not finish for by this time she was bending down and punching
under the bed with the broom and so she needed breath to punctuate the
punches with she resurrected nothing but the cat

i never did see the beat of that boy

she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
tomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden no tom so
she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted

y o u u tom

there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight

there i might a thought of that closet what you been doing in
there

nothing

nothing look at your hands and look at your mouth what is that
truck

i dont know aunt

well i know its jam thats what it is forty times ive said if you
didnt let that jam alone id skin you hand me that switch

the switch hovered in the air the peril was desperate

my look behind you aunt

the old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger
the lad fled on the instant scrambled up the high board fence and
disappeared over it

his aunt polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle
laugh

hang the boy cant i never learn anything aint he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time but old
fools is the biggest fools there is cant learn an old dog new tricks
as the saying is but my goodness he never plays them alike two days
and how is a body to know whats coming he pears to know just how long
he can torment me before i get my dander up and he knows if he can make
out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh its all down again and
i cant hit him a lick i aint doing my duty by that boy and thats
the lords truth goodness knows spare the rod and spile the child
as the good book says im a laying up sin and suffering for us both
i know hes full of the old scratch but laws a me hes my own
dead sisters boy poor thing and i aint got the heart to lash him
somehow every time i let him off my conscience does hurt me so and
every time i hit him my old heart most breaks well a well man that is
born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as the scripture
says and i reckon its so hell play hookey this evening and
southwestern for afternoon ill just be obleeged to make him work
tomorrow to punish him its mighty hard to make him work saturdays
when all the boys is having holiday but he hates work more than he
hates anything else and ive got to do some of my duty by him or
ill be the ruination of the child

tom did play hookey and he had a very good time he got back home
barely in season to help jim the small colored boy saw next days wood
and split the kindlings before supper at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three fourths of the work
toms younger brother or rather half brother sid was already through
with his part of the work picking up chips for he was a quiet boy
and had no adventurous trouble some ways

while tom was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile and
very deep for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments like
many other simple hearted souls it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning said she

tom it was middling warm in school warnt it

yesm

powerful warm warnt it

yesm

didnt you want to go in a swimming tom

a bit of a scare shot through tom a touch of uncomfortable suspicion he
searched aunt pollys face but it told him nothing so he said

nom well not very much

the old lady reached out her hand and felt toms shirt and said

but you aint too warm now though and it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind but in spite of her tom knew
where the wind lay now so he forestalled what might be the next move

some of us pumped on our heads mines damp yet see

aunt polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence and missed a trick then she had a new
inspiration

tom you didnt have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it to
pump on your head did you unbutton your jacket

the trouble vanished out of toms face he opened his jacket his shirt
collar was securely sewed

bother well go long with you id made sure youd played hookey
and been a swimming but i forgive ye tom i reckon youre a kind of a
singed cat as the saying is bettern you look this time

she was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried and half glad that tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once

but sidney said

well now if i didnt think you sewed his collar with white thread
but its black

why i did sew it with white tom

but tom did not wait for the rest as he went out at the door he said

siddy ill lick you for that

in a safe place tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket and had thread bound about them one needle
carried white thread and the other black he said

shed never noticed if it hadnt been for sid confound it sometimes
she sews it with white and sometimes she sews it with black i wish to
gee miny shed stick to one or tother i cant keep the run of em but
i bet you ill lam sid for that ill learn him

he was not the model boy of the village he knew the model boy very well
though and loathed him

within two minutes or even less he had forgotten all his troubles not
because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
mans are to a man but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time just as mens
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises this new
interest was a valued novelty in whistling which he had just acquired
from a negro and he was suffering to practise it un disturbed it
consisted in a peculiar bird like turn a sort of liquid warble
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the music the reader probably remembers how to
do it if he has ever been a boy diligence and attention soon gave him
the knack of it and he strode down the street with his mouth full of
harmony and his soul full of gratitude he felt much as an astronomer
feels who has discovered a new planet no doubt as far as strong deep
unalloyed pleasure is concerned the advantage was with the boy not the
astronomer

the summer evenings were long it was not dark yet presently tom
checked his whistle a stranger was before him a boy a shade larger
than himself a new comer of any age or either sex was an im pressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of st petersburg this boy
was well dressed too well dressed on a week day this was simply as
astounding his cap was a dainty thing his close buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty and so were his pantaloons he had shoes
on and it was only friday he even wore a necktie a bright bit of
ribbon he had a citified air about him that ate into toms vitals the
more tom stared at the splendid marvel the higher he turned up his nose
at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to
him to grow neither boy spoke if one moved the other moved but only
sidewise in a circle they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
time finally tom said

i can lick you

id like to see you try it

well i can do it

no you cant either

yes i can

no you cant

i can

you cant

can

cant

an uncomfortable pause then tom said

whats your name

tisnt any of your business maybe

well i low ill make it my business

well why dont you

if you say much i will

much much much there now

oh you think youre mighty smart dont you i could lick you with
one hand tied behind me if i wanted to

well why dont you do it you say you can do it

well i will if you fool with me

oh yes ive seen whole families in the same fix

smarty you think youre some now dont you oh what a hat

you can lump that hat if you dont like it i dare you to knock it
off and anybody thatll take a dare will suck eggs

youre a liar

youre another

youre a fighting liar and dasnt take it up

aw take a walk

say if you give me much more of your sass ill take and bounce a rock
offn your head

oh of course you will

well i will

well why dont you do it then what do you keep saying you will
for why dont you do it its because youre afraid

i aint afraid

you are

i aint

you are

another pause and more eying and sidling around each other presently
they were shoulder to shoulder tom said

get away from here

go away yourself

i wont

i wont either

so they stood each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace and both
shoving with might and main and glowering at each other with hate but
neither could get an advantage after struggling till both were hot and
flushed each relaxed his strain with watchful caution and tom said

youre a coward and a pup ill tell my big brother on you and he can
thrash you with his little finger and ill make him do it too

what do i care for your big brother ive got a brother thats bigger
than he is and whats more he can throw him over that fence too
both brothers were imaginary

thats a lie

your saying so dont make it so

tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe and said

i dare you to step over that and ill lick you till you cant stand
up anybody thatll take a dare will steal sheep

the new boy stepped over promptly and said

now you said youd do it now lets see you do it

dont you crowd me now you better look out

well you said youd do it why dont you do it

by jingo for two cents i will do it

the new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision tom struck them to the ground in an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt gripped together like cats and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each others hair and
clothes punched and scratched each others nose and covered themselves
with dust and glory presently the confusion took form and through the
fog of battle tom appeared seated astride the new boy and pounding him
with his fists holler nuff said he

the boy only struggled to free himself he was crying mainly from rage

holler nuff and the pounding went on

at last the stranger got out a smothered nuff and tom let him up and
said

now thatll learn you better look out who youre fooling with next
time

the new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes sobbing
snuffling and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to tom the next time he caught him out
to which tom responded with jeers and started off in high feather and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone threw it
and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope tom chased the traitor home and thus found out where he
lived he then held a position at the gate for some time daring the
enemy to come outside but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined at last the enemys mother appeared and called tom
a bad vicious vulgar child and ordered him away so he went away but
he said he lowed to lay for that boy

he got home pretty late that night and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his aunt and
when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
firmness




chapter ii

saturday morning was come and all the summer world was bright and
fresh and brimming with life there was a song in every heart and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips there was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step the locust trees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air cardiff hill beyond
the village and above it was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a delectable land dreamy reposeful and inviting

tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long handled brush he surveyed the fence and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high life to him seemed hollow and existence but a
burden sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank repeated the operation did it again compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence and sat down on a tree box discouraged jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail and singing buffalo gals bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in toms eyes before but
now it did not strike him so he remembered that there was company at
the pump white mulatto and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrelling fighting
skylarking and he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
and fifty yards off jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
hour and even then somebody generally had to go after him tom said

say jim ill fetch the water if youll whitewash some

jim shook his head and said

cant mars tom ole missis she tole me i got to go an git dis water
an not stop foolin roun wid anybody she say she spec mars tom gwine
to ax me to whitewash an so she tole me go long an tend to my own
business she lowed shed tend to de whitewashin

oh never you mind what she said jim thats the way she always talks
gimme the bucket i wont be gone only a a minute she wont ever
know

oh i dasnt mars tom ole missis shed take an tar de head offn me
deed she would

she she never licks anybody whacks em over the head with her
thimble and who cares for that id like to know she talks awful but
talk dont hurt anyways it dont if she dont cry jim ill give you a
marvel ill give you a white alley

jim began to waver

white alley jim and its a bully taw

my dats a mighty gay marvel i tell you but mars tom is powerful
fraid ole missis

and besides if you will ill show you my sore toe

jim was only human this attraction was too much for him he put down
his pail took the white alley and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound in another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear tom was
whitewashing with vigor and aunt polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye

but toms energy did not last he began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day and his sorrows multiplied soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work the very
thought of it burnt him like fire he got out his worldly wealth and
examined it bits of toys marbles and trash enough to buy an exchange
of work maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour
of pure freedom so he returned his straitened means to his pocket and
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys at this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him nothing less than a great
magnificent inspiration

he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work ben rogers hove in
sight presently the very boy of all boys whose ridicule he had been
dreading bens gait was the hop skip and jump proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high he was eating an apple and
giving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deep toned
ding dong dong ding dong dong for he was personating a steamboat as
he drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp
and circumstance for he was personating the big missouri and considered
himself to be drawing nine feet of water he was boat and captain and
engine bells combined so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
hurricane deck giving the orders and executing them

stop her sir ting a ling ling the headway ran almost out and he
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk

ship up to back ting a ling ling his arms straightened and stiffened
down his sides

set her back on the stabboard ting a ling ling chow ch chow wow
chow his right hand mean time describing stately circles for it was
representing a forty foot wheel

let her go back on the labboard ting a ling ling chow ch chow chow
the left hand began to describe circles

stop the stabboard ting a ling ling stop the labboard come ahead on
the stabboard stop her let your outside turn over slow ting a ling ling
chow ow ow get out that head line lively now come out with
your spring line whatre you about there take a turn round that stump
with the bight of it stand by that stage now let her go done with
the engines sir ting a ling ling sht sht sht trying the
gauge cocks

tom went on whitewashing paid no attention to the steamboat ben stared
a moment and then said hi yi youre up a stump aint you

no answer tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result as
before ben ranged up alongside of him toms mouth watered for the
apple but he stuck to his work ben said

hello old chap you got to work hey

tom wheeled suddenly and said

why its you ben i warnt noticing

say im going in a swimming i am dont you wish you could but of
course youd druther work wouldnt you course you would

tom contemplated the boy a bit and said

what do you call work

why aint that work

tom resumed his whitewashing and answered carelessly

well maybe it is and maybe it aint all i know is it suits tom
sawyer

oh come now you dont mean to let on that you like it

the brush continued to move

like it well i dont see why i oughtnt to like it does a boy get a
chance to whitewash a fence every day

that put the thing in a new light ben stopped nibbling his apple
tom swept his brush daintily back and forth stepped back to note the
effect added a touch here and there criticised the effect again ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested more and more
absorbed presently he said

say tom let me whitewash a little

tom considered was about to consent but he altered his mind

no no i reckon it wouldnt hardly do ben you see aunt pollys awful
particular about this fence right here on the street you know but if it
was the back fence i wouldnt mind and she wouldnt yes shes awful
particular about this fence its got to be done very careful i reckon
there aint one boy in a thousand maybe two thousand that can do it
the way its got to be done

no is that so oh come now lemme just try only just a little id let
you if you was me tom

ben id like to honest injun but aunt polly well jim wanted to do
it but she wouldnt let him sid wanted to do it and she wouldnt let
sid now dont you see how im fixed if you was to tackle this fence
and anything was to happen to it

oh shucks ill be just as careful now lemme try say ill give you
the core of my apple

well here no ben now dont im afeard

ill give you all of it

tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his
heart and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the
sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by
dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more
innocents there was no lack of material boys happened along every
little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash by the time
ben was fagged out tom had traded the next chance to billy fisher for
a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so on hour
after hour and when the middle of the afternoon came from being a
poor poverty stricken boy in the morning tom was literally rolling in
wealth he had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles part
of a jews harp a piece of blue bottle glass to look through a spool
cannon a key that wouldnt unlock anything a fragment of chalk a
glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles
six fire crackers a kitten with only one eye a brass door knob a
dog collar but no dog the handle of a knife four pieces of orange peel
and a dilapidated old window sash

he had had a nice good idle time all the while plenty of company and
the fence had three coats of whitewash on it if he hadnt run out of
whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village

tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all he
had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namely
that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary
to make the thing difficult to attain if he had been a great and
wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have
comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do
and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do and
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
performing on a tread mill is work while rolling ten pins or climbing
mont blanc is only amusement there are wealthy gentlemen in england
who drive four horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles on a
daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable
money but if they were offered wages for the service that would turn
it into work and then they would resign

the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to
report




chapter iii

tom presented himself before aunt polly who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom
breakfast room dining room and library combined the balmy summer
air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing
murmur of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her
knitting for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her
lap her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety she had
thought that of course tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at
seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way he
said maynt i go and play now aunt

what aready how much have you done

its all done aunt

tom dont lie to me i cant bear it

i aint aunt it is all done

aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence she went out to see for
herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of
toms statement true when she found the entire fence white washed and
not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even a
streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable she
said

well i never theres no getting round it you can work when youre a
mind to tom and then she diluted the compliment by adding but its
powerful seldom youre a mind to im bound to say well go long and
play but mind you get back some time in a week or ill tan you

she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him
along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort
and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish he hooked a
doughnut

then he skipped out and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling they raged around sid like a
hail storm and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect
and tom was over the fence and gone there was a gate but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it his soul was at
peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble

tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
back of his aunts cow stable he presently got safely beyond the reach
of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square of the
village where two military companies of boys had met for conflict
according to previous appointment tom was general of one of these
armies joe harper a bosom friend general of the other these two
great commanders did not condescend to fight in person that being better
suited to the still smaller fry but sat together on an eminence
and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aides de camp toms army won a great victory after a long and
hard fought battle then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the
necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and
marched away and tom turned homeward alone

as he was passing by the house where jeff thatcher lived he saw a new
girl in the garden a lovely little blue eyed creature with yellow
hair plaited into two long tails white summer frock and embroidered
pan talettes the fresh crowned hero fell without firing a shot a
certain amy lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind he had thought he loved her to distraction
he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality he had been months winning her she had
confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done

he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she had
discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present and
began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to win
her admiration he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time
but by and by while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
her way toward the house tom came up to the fence and leaned on it
grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer she halted a
moment on the steps and then moved toward the door tom heaved a great
sigh as she put her foot on the threshold but his face lit up
right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
disappeared

the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and
then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as
if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction
presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side
in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally his
bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he hopped
away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner but only for a
minute only while he could button the flower inside his jacket next
his heart or next his stomach possibly for he was not much posted in
anatomy and not hypercritical anyway

he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing
off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom
comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
window meantime and been aware of his attentions finally he strode
home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions

all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what
had got into the child he took a good scolding about clodding sid and
did not seem to mind it in the least he tried to steal sugar under his
aunts very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it he said

aunt you dont whack sid when he takes it

well sid dont torment a body the way you do youd be always into
that sugar if i warnt watching you

presently she stepped into the kitchen and sid happy in his immunity
reached for the sugar bowl a sort of glorying over tom which was
wellnigh unbearable but sids fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and
broke tom was in ecstasies in such ecstasies that he even controlled
his tongue and was silent he said to himself that he would not speak a
word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly still till she
asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and there would be
nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model catch it he was
so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath
from over her spectacles he said to himself now its coming and the
next instant he was sprawling on the floor the potent palm was uplifted
to strike again when tom cried out

hold on now what er you belting me for sid broke it

aunt polly paused perplexed and tom looked for healing pity but when
she got her tongue again she only said

umf well you didnt get a lick amiss i reckon you been into some
other audacious mischief when i wasnt around like enough

then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say something
kind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that
so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart
tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes he knew that in her heart
his aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by the
consciousness of it he would hang out no signals he would take notice
of none he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and then
through a film of tears but he refused recognition of it he pictured
himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
one little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall and
die with that word unsaid ah how would she feel then and he pictured
himself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet and
his sore heart at rest how she would throw herself upon him and how
her tears would fall like rain and her lips pray god to give her back
her boy and she would never never abuse him any more but he would
lie there cold and white and make no sign a poor little sufferer whose
griefs were at an end he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like to choke
and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when he winked
and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose and such a luxury to
him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bear to have any
worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it it was too
sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousin mary danced
in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age long visit
of one week to the country he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other

he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys and sought desolate
places that were in harmony with his spirit a log raft in the river
invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated
the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the while that he could
only be drowned all at once and unconsciously without undergoing the
uncomfortable routine devised by nature then he thought of his flower
he got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightily increased his dismal
felicity he wondered if she would pity him if she knew would she
cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and
comfort him or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world
this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he
worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and
varied lights till he wore it threadbare at last he rose up sighing
and departed in the darkness

about half past nine or ten oclock he came along the deserted street to
where the adored unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fell upon
his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain
of a second story window was the sacred presence there he climbed the
fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants till he stood under
that window he looked up at it long and with emotion then he laid him
down on the ground under it disposing himself upon his back with his
hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower
and thus he would die out in the cold world with no shelter over his
homeless head no friendly hand to wipe the death damps from his brow
no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came and
thus she would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning and
oh would she drop one little tear upon his poor lifeless form would
she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted
so untimely cut down

the window went up a maid servants discordant voice profaned the holy
calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyrs remains

the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort there was a whiz
as of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a sound
as of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over the
fence and shot away in the gloom

not long after as tom all undressed for bed was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip sid woke up but if he
had any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thought
better of it and held his peace for there was danger in toms eye

tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers and sid made mental
note of the omission




chapter iv

the sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction breakfast over aunt polly had family
worship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar of
originality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
the mosaic law as from sinai

then tom girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to get
his verses sid had learned his lesson days before tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of the
sermon on the mount because he could find no verses that were shorter
at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson
but no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations mary took
his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way through the
fog

blessed are the a a

poor

yes poor blessed are the poor a a

in spirit

in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for they they

theirs

for theirs blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they they

sh

for they a

s h a

for they s h oh i dont know what it is

shall

oh shall for they shall for they shall a a shall mourn a a blessed
are they that shall they that a they that shall mourn for they
shall a shall what why dont you tell me mary what do you want to
be so mean for

oh tom you poor thick headed thing im not teasing you i wouldnt
do that you must go and learn it again dont you be discouraged tom
youll manage it and if you do ill give you something ever so nice
there now thats a good boy

all right what is it mary tell me what it is

never you mind tom you know if i say its nice it is nice

you bet you thats so mary all right ill tackle it again

and he did tackle it again and under the double pressure of curiosity
and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a
shining success mary gave him a brand new barlow knife worth twelve
and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that swept his system
shook him to his foundations true the knife would not cut anything
but it was a sure enough barlow and there was inconceivable grandeur
in that though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a
weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain so perhaps tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it and was arranging to begin on the bureau when he was
called off to dress for sunday school

mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves
poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door but
mary removed the towel and said

now aint you ashamed tom you mustnt be so bad water wont hurt
you

tom was a trifle disconcerted the basin was refilled and this time he
stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big breath
and began when he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes shut
and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony of
suds and water was dripping from his face but when he emerged from
the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck mary took him in hand and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction of
color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect he privately
smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his
hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and his
own filled his life with bitterness then mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years they were
simply called his other clothes and so by that we know the size of his
wardrobe the girl put him to rights after he had dressed himself
she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his vast shirt
collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned him with
his speckled straw hat he now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him he
hoped that mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she
coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought
them out he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didnt want to do but mary said persuasively

please tom thats a good boy

so he got into the shoes snarling mary was soon ready and the three
children set out for sunday school a place that tom hated with his whole
heart but sid and mary were fond of it

sabbath school hours were from nine to half past ten and then church
service two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily
and the other always remained too for stronger reasons the churchs
high backed uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons
the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort of pine board
tree box on top of it for a steeple at the door tom dropped back a step
and accosted a sunday dressed comrade

say billy got a yaller ticket

yes

whatll you take for her

whatll you give

piece of lickrish and a fish hook

less see em

tom exhibited they were satisfactory and the property changed hands
then tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and some
small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones he waylaid other
boys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten
or fifteen minutes longer he entered the church now with a swarm
of clean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started
a quarrel with the first boy that came handy the teacher a grave
elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and tom pulled a
boys hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear
him say ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher toms whole
class were of a pattern restless noisy and troublesome when they came
to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses perfectly but
had to be prompted all along however they worried through and each
got his reward in small blue tickets each with a passage of scripture
on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation ten
blue tickets equalled a red one and could be exchanged for it ten red
tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
gave a very plainly bound bible worth forty cents in those easy
times to the pupil how many of my readers would have the industry and
application to memorize two thousand verses even for a dore bible and
yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way it was the patient work of
two years and a boy of german parentage had won four or five he once
recited three thousand verses without stopping but the strain upon his
mental faculties was too great and he was little better than an idiot
from that day forth a grievous misfortune for the school for on great
occasions before company the superintendent as tom expressed it
had always made this boy come out and spread himself only the older
pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
long enough to get a bible and so the delivery of one of these prizes
was a rare and noteworthy circumstance the successful pupil was so
great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholars
heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple
of weeks it is possible that toms mental stomach had never really
hungered for one of those prizes but unquestionably his entire being
had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it

in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with
a closed hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves and commanded attention when a sunday school superintendent
makes his customary little speech a hymn book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert though
why is a mystery for neither the hymn book nor the sheet of music
is ever referred to by the sufferer this superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty five with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair he
wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth a
fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank note and had
fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the fashion
of the day like sleigh runners an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours together mr walters was very earnest of mien and very
sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred things and places
in such reverence and so separated them from worldly matters that
unconsciously to himself his sunday school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on week days he began after this
fashion

now children i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two there that
is it that is the way good little boys and girls should do i see one
little girl who is looking out of the window i am afraid she thinks i
am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech
to the little birds applausive titter i want to tell you how good it
makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces assembled in a
place like this learning to do right and be good and so forth and so
on it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration it was of a
pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar to us all

the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary but now every sound
ceased suddenly with the subsidence of mr walters voice and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude

a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less rare the entrance of visitors lawyer thatcher accompanied
by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middle aged gentleman
with iron gray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latters
wife the lady was leading a child tom had been restless and full of
chafings and repinings conscience smitten too he could not meet amy
lawrences eye he could not brook her loving gaze but when he saw this
small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment the next
moment he was showing off with all his might cuffing boys pulling
hair making faces in a word using every art that seemed likely to
fascinate a girl and win her applause his exaltation had but one
alloy the memory of his humiliation in this angels garden and that
record in sand was fast washing out under the waves of happiness that
were sweeping over it now

the visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as mr
walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school the
middle aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage no less a one
than the county judge altogether the most august creation these children
had ever looked upon and they wondered what kind of material he was made
of and they half wanted to hear him roar and were half afraid he might
too he was from constantinople twelve miles away so he had travelled
and seen the world these very eyes had looked upon the county
court house which was said to have a tin roof the awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes this was the great judge thatcher brother of
their own lawyer jeff thatcher immediately went forward to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school it would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings

look at him jim hes a going up there say look hes a going to
shake hands with him he is shaking hands with him by jings dont you
wish you was jeff

mr walters fell to showing off with all sorts of official bustlings
and activities giving orders delivering judgments discharging
directions here there everywhere that he could find a target the
librarian showed off running hither and thither with his arms full of
books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
delights in the young lady teachers showed off bending sweetly over
pupils that were lately being boxed lifting pretty warning fingers
at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly the young gentlemen
teachers showed off with small scoldings and other little displays of
authority and fine attention to discipline and most of the teachers of
both sexes found business up at the library by the pulpit and it was
business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
with much seeming vexation the little girls showed off in various
ways and the little boys showed off with such diligence that the air
was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings and above it
all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all
the house and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur for he was
showing off too

there was only one thing wanting to make mr walters ecstasy complete
and that was a chance to deliver a bible prize and exhibit a prodigy
several pupils had a few yellow tickets but none had enough he had been
around among the star pupils inquiring he would have given worlds now
to have that german lad back again with a sound mind

and now at this moment when hope was dead tom sawyer came forward with
nine yellow tickets nine red tickets and ten blue ones and demanded
a bible this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky walters was not
expecting an application from this source for the next ten years but
there was no getting around it here were the certified checks and they
were good for their face tom was therefore elevated to a place with
the judge and the other elect and the great news was announced from
headquarters it was the most stunning surprise of the decade and
so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
judicial ones altitude and the school had two marvels to gaze upon
in place of one the boys were all eaten up with envy but those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges
these despised themselves as being the dupes of a wily fraud a
guileful snake in the grass

the prize was delivered to tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush for the poor fellows instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light
perhaps it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premises a dozen would
strain his capacity without a doubt

amy lawrence was proud and glad and she tried to make tom see it in
her face but he wouldnt look she wondered then she was just a grain
troubled next a dim suspicion came and went came again she watched
a furtive glance told her worlds and then her heart broke and she was
jealous and angry and the tears came and she hated everybody tom most
of all she thought

tom was introduced to the judge but his tongue was tied his breath
would hardly come his heart quaked partly because of the awful
greatness of the man but mainly because he was her parent he would
have liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark the
judge put his hand on toms head and called him a fine little man and
asked him what his name was the boy stammered gasped and got it out

tom

oh no not tom it is

thomas

ah thats it i thought there was more to it maybe thats very well
but youve another one i daresay and youll tell it to me wont you

tell the gentleman your other name thomas said walters and say
sir you mustnt forget your manners

thomas sawyer sir

thats it thats a good boy fine boy fine manly little fellow two
thousand verses is a great many very very great many and you never can
be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them for knowledge is worth
more than anything there is in the world its what makes great men
and good men youll be a great man and a good man yourself some
day thomas and then youll look back and say its all owing to the
precious sunday school privileges of my boyhood its all owing to
my dear teachers that taught me to learn its all owing to the good
superintendent who encouraged me and watched over me and gave me a
beautiful bible a splendid elegant bible to keep and have it all for my
own always its all owing to right bringing up that is what you will
say thomas and you wouldnt take any money for those two thousand
verses no indeed you wouldnt and now you wouldnt mind telling me and
this lady some of the things youve learned no i know you wouldnt for
we are proud of little boys that learn now no doubt you know the names
of all the twelve disciples wont you tell us the names of the first
two that were appointed

tom was tugging at a button hole and looking sheepish he blushed
now and his eyes fell mr walters heart sank within him he said
to himself it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question why did the judge ask him yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say

answer the gentleman thomas dont be afraid

tom still hung fire

now i know youll tell me said the lady the names of the first two
disciples were

david and goliah

let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene




chapter v

about half past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring
and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon the
sunday school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents so as to be under supervision aunt
polly came and tom and sid and mary sat with her tom being placed next
the aisle in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible the crowd filed up
the aisles the aged and needy postmaster who had seen better days
the mayor and his wife for they had a mayor there among other
unnecessaries the justice of the peace the widow douglass fair
smart and forty a generous good hearted soul and well to do her hill
mansion the only palace in the town and the most hospitable and much
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st petersburg could
boast the bent and venerable major and mrs ward lawyer riverson the
new notable from a distance next the belle of the village followed by
a troop of lawn clad and ribbon decked young heart breakers then all
the young clerks in town in a body for they had stood in the vestibule
sucking their cane heads a circling wall of oiled and simpering
admirers till the last girl had run their gantlet and last of all came
the model boy willie mufferson taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut glass he always brought his mother to church and was
the pride of all the matrons the boys all hated him he was so
good and besides he had been thrown up to them so much his
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind as usual on
sundays accidentally tom had no handkerchief and he looked upon boys
who had as snobs

the congregation being fully assembled now the bell rang once more
to warn laggards and stragglers and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery the choir always tittered and whispered all
through service there was once a church choir that was not ill bred
but i have forgotten where it was now it was a great many years ago
and i can scarcely remember anything about it but i think it was in
some foreign country

the minister gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish in a
peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country his
voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
certain point where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
and then plunged down as if from a spring board

shall i be car ri ed toe the skies on flowry beds of ease

whilst others fight to win the prize and sail thro blood y seas

he was regarded as a wonderful reader at church sociables he was
always called upon to read poetry and when he was through the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps
and wall their eyes and shake their heads as much as to say words
cannot express it it is too beautiful too beautiful for this mortal
earth

after the hymn had been sung the rev mr sprague turned himself into
a bulletin board and read off notices of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
doom a queer custom which is still kept up in america even in cities
away here in this age of abundant newspapers often the less there is
to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it

and now the minister prayed a good generous prayer it was and went
into details it pleaded for the church and the little children of the
church for the other churches of the village for the village itself
for the county for the state for the state officers for the united
states for the churches of the united states for congress for the
president for the officers of the government for poor sailors tossed
by stormy seas for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
european monarchies and oriental despotisms for such as have the light
and the good tidings and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal for the heathen in the far islands of the sea and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor and be as seed sown in fertile ground yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good amen

there was a rustling of dresses and the standing congregation sat down
the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer he
only endured it if he even did that much he was restive all through it
he kept tally of the details of the prayer unconsciously for he was not
listening but he knew the ground of old and the clergymans regular
route over it and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded
his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it he considered
additions unfair and scoundrelly in the midst of the prayer a fly had
lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
calmly rubbing its hands together embracing its head with its arms and
polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
the body and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view scraping
its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
had been coat tails going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if
it knew it was perfectly safe as indeed it was for as sorely as toms
hands itched to grab for it they did not dare he believed his soul would
be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going
on but with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal
forward and the instant the amen was out the fly was a prisoner of
war his aunt detected the act and made him let it go

the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod and
yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
worth the saving tom counted the pages of the sermon after church he
always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knew anything
else about the discourse however this time he was really interested
for a little while the minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the worlds hosts at the millennium when the lion
and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead
them but the pathos the lesson the moral of the great spectacle
were lost upon the boy he only thought of the conspicuousness of the
principal character before the on looking nations his face lit with the
thought and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child
if it was a tame lion

now he lapsed into suffering again as the dry argument was resumed
presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out it was
a large black beetle with formidable jaws a pinchbug he called it it
was in a percussion cap box the first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger a natural fillip followed the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back and the hurt finger went
into the boys mouth the beetle lay there working its helpless legs
unable to turn over tom eyed it and longed for it but it was safe out
of his reach other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
the beetle and they eyed it too presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling along sad at heart lazy with the summer softness and the
quiet weary of captivity sighing for change he spied the beetle the
drooping tail lifted and wagged he surveyed the prize walked around
it smelt at it from a safe distance walked around it again grew
bolder and took a closer smell then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at it just missing it made another and another began to enjoy
the diversion subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws
and continued his experiments grew weary at last and then indifferent
and absent minded his head nodded and little by little his chin
descended and touched the enemy who seized it there was a sharp yelp
a flirt of the poodles head and the beetle fell a couple of yards
away and lit on its back once more the neighboring spectators
shook with a gentle inward joy several faces went behind fans and
hand kerchiefs and tom was entirely happy the dog looked foolish
and probably felt so but there was resentment in his heart too and a
craving for revenge so he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
it again jumping at it from every point of a circle lighting with his
fore paws within an inch of the creature making even closer snatches at
it with his teeth and jerking his head till his ears flapped again but
he grew tired once more after a while tried to amuse himself with a
fly but found no relief followed an ant around with his nose close
to the floor and quickly wearied of that yawned sighed forgot the
beetle entirely and sat down on it then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the aisle the yelps continued and so
did the dog he crossed the house in front of the altar he flew
down the other aisle he crossed before the doors he clamored up the
home stretch his anguish grew with his progress till presently he was
but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
light at last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course and sprang
into its masters lap he flung it out of the window and the voice of
distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance

by this time the whole church was red faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter and the sermon had come to a dead standstill
the discourse was resumed presently but it went lame and halting all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth under cover of some remote pew back as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious thing it was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced

tom sawyer went home quite cheerful thinking to himself that there was
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
in it he had but one marring thought he was willing that the dog
should play with his pinchbug but he did not think it was upright in
him to carry it off




chapter vi

monday morning found tom sawyer miserable monday morning always found
him so because it began another weeks slow suffering in school he
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday
it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious

tom lay thinking presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick then he could stay home from school here was a vague possibility
he canvassed his system no ailment was found and he investigated
again this time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms and he
began to encourage them with considerable hope but they soon grew
feeble and presently died wholly away he reflected further suddenly
he discovered something one of his upper front teeth was loose this
was lucky he was about to begin to groan as a starter as he
called it when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
argument his aunt would pull it out and that would hurt so he thought
he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present and seek further
nothing offered for some little time and then he remembered hearing
the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger so the boy eagerly
drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection
but now he did not know the necessary symptoms however it seemed
well worth while to chance it so he fell to groaning with considerable
spirit

but sid slept on unconscious

tom groaned louder and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe

no result from sid

tom was panting with his exertions by this time he took a rest and then
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans

sid snored on

tom was aggravated he said sid sid and shook him this course
worked well and tom began to groan again sid yawned stretched then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort and began to stare at tom
tom went on groaning sid said

tom say tom no response here tom tom what is the matter
tom and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously

tom moaned out

oh dont sid dont joggle me

why whats the matter tom i must call auntie

no never mind itll be over by and by maybe dont call anybody

but i must dont groan so tom its awful how long you been this
way

hours ouch oh dont stir so sid youll kill me

tom why didnt you wake me sooner oh tom dont it makes my flesh
crawl to hear you tom what is the matter

i forgive you everything sid groan everything youve ever done to
me when im gone

oh tom you aint dying are you dont tom oh dont maybe

i forgive everybody sid groan tell em so sid and sid you give
my window sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thats come to
town and tell her

but sid had snatched his clothes and gone tom was suffering in reality
now so handsomely was his imagination working and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine tone

sid flew downstairs and said

oh aunt polly come toms dying

dying

yesm dont wait come quick

rubbage i dont believe it

but she fled upstairs nevertheless with sid and mary at her heels
and her face grew white too and her lip trembled when she reached the
bedside she gasped out

you tom tom whats the matter with you

oh auntie im

whats the matter with you what is the matter with you child

oh auntie my sore toes mortified

the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little then cried a
little then did both together this restored her and she said

tom what a turn you did give me now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this

the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe the boy felt a
little foolish and he said

aunt polly it seemed mortified and it hurt so i never minded my
tooth at all

your tooth indeed whats the matter with your tooth

one of thems loose and it aches perfectly awful

there there now dont begin that groaning again open your mouth
well your tooth is loose but youre not going to die about that
mary get me a silk thread and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen

tom said

oh please auntie dont pull it out it dont hurt any more i wish
i may never stir if it does please dont auntie i dont want to stay
home from school

oh you dont dont you so all this row was because you thought youd
get to stay home from school and go a fishing tom tom i love you so
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
outrageousness by this time the dental instruments were ready the old
lady made one end of the silk thread fast to toms tooth with a loop
and tied the other to the bedpost then she seized the chunk of fire and
suddenly thrust it almost into the boys face the tooth hung dangling
by the bedpost now

but all trials bring their compensations as tom wended to school after
breakfast he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
way he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
homage up to this time now found himself suddenly without an adherent
and shorn of his glory his heart was heavy and he said with a disdain
which he did not feel that it wasnt anything to spit like tom sawyer
but another boy said sour grapes and he wandered away a dismantled
hero

shortly tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village huckleberry
finn son of the town drunkard huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the town because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and bad and because all their children admired him so and
delighted in his forbidden society and wished they dared to be like
him tom was like the rest of the respectable boys in that he envied
huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition and was under strict orders
not to play with him so he played with him every time he got a chance
huckleberry was always dressed in the cast off clothes of full grown
men and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags his hat
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim his coat
when he wore one hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
far down the back but one suspender supported his trousers the seat of
the trousers bagged low and contained nothing the fringed legs dragged
in the dirt when not rolled up

huckleberry came and went at his own free will he slept on doorsteps
in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet he did not have to go to
school or to church or call any being master or obey anybody he could
go fishing or swimming when and where he chose and stay as long as it
suited him nobody forbade him to fight he could sit up as late as he
pleased he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
and the last to resume leather in the fall he never had to wash nor
put on clean clothes he could swear wonderfully in a word everything
that goes to make life precious that boy had so thought every harassed
hampered respectable boy in st petersburg

tom hailed the romantic outcast

hello huckleberry

hello yourself and see how you like it

whats that you got

dead cat

lemme see him huck my hes pretty stiff whered you get him

bought him offn a boy

what did you give

i give a blue ticket and a bladder that i got at the slaughter house

whered you get the blue ticket

bought it offn ben rogers two weeks ago for a hoop stick

say what is dead cats good for huck

good for cure warts with

no is that so i know something thats better

i bet you dont what is it

why spunk water

spunk water i wouldnt give a dern for spunk water

you wouldnt wouldnt you dyou ever try it

no i haint but bob tanner did

who told you so

why he told jeff thatcher and jeff told johnny baker and johnny
told jim hollis and jim told ben rogers and ben told a nigger and the
nigger told me there now

well what of it theyll all lie leastways all but the nigger i
dont know him but i never see a nigger that wouldnt lie shucks
now you tell me how bob tanner done it huck

why he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain water
was

in the daytime

certainly

with his face to the stump

yes least i reckon so

did he say anything

i dont reckon he did i dont know

aha talk about trying to cure warts with spunk water such a blame fool
way as that why that aint a going to do any good you got to go all
by yourself to the middle of the woods where you know theres a
spunk water stump and just as its midnight you back up against the stump
and jam your hand in and say

barley corn barley corn injun meal shorts spunk water spunk water
swaller these warts

and then walk away quick eleven steps with your eyes shut and then
turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody
because if you speak the charms busted

well that sounds like a good way but that aint the way bob tanner
done

no sir you can bet he didnt becuz hes the wartiest boy in this
town and he wouldnt have a wart on him if hed knowed how to work
spunk water ive took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way
huck i play with frogs so much that ive always got considerable many
warts sometimes i take em off with a bean

yes beans good ive done that

have you whats your way

you take and split the bean and cut the wart so as to get some blood
and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig
a hole and bury it bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the
moon and then you burn up the rest of the bean you see that piece
thats got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing trying to
fetch the other piece to it and so that helps the blood to draw the
wart and pretty soon off she comes

yes thats it huck thats it though when youre burying it if you
say down bean off wart come no more to bother me its better
thats the way joe harper does and hes been nearly to coonville and
most everywheres but say how do you cure em with dead cats

why you take your cat and go and get in the grave yard long about
midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried and when its
midnight a devil will come or maybe two or three but you cant see
em you can only hear something like the wind or maybe hear em talk
and when theyre taking that feller away you heave your cat after em
and say devil follow corpse cat follow devil warts follow cat im
done with ye thatll fetch any wart

sounds right dyou ever try it huck

no but old mother hopkins told me

well i reckon its so then becuz they say shes a witch

say why tom i know she is she witched pap pap says so his own
self he come along one day and he see she was a witching him so he
took up a rock and if she hadnt dodged hed a got her well that
very night he rolled offn a shed wher he was a layin drunk and broke
his arm

why thats awful how did he know she was a witching him

lord pap can tell easy pap says when they keep looking at you right
stiddy theyre a witching you specially if they mumble becuz when
they mumble theyre saying the lords prayer backards

say hucky when you going to try the cat

to night i reckon theyll come after old hoss williams to night

but they buried him saturday didnt they get him saturday night

why how you talk how could their charms work till midnight and
then its sunday devils dont slosh around much of a sunday i dont
reckon

i never thought of that thats so lemme go with you

of course if you aint afeard

afeard taint likely will you meow

ill meow this time say whats that

nothing but a tick

whered you get him

out in the woods

i dont know i dont want to sell him

all right its a mighty small tick anyway

oh anybody can run a tick down that dont belong to them im
satisfied with it its a good enough tick for me

sho theres ticks a plenty i could have a thousand of em if i wanted
to

well why dont you becuz you know mighty well you cant this is a
pretty early tick i reckon its the first one ive seen this year

say huck ill give you my tooth for him

less see it

tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it huckleberry viewed
it wistfully the temptation was very strong at last he said

is it genuwyne

tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy

well all right said huckleberry its a trade

tom enclosed the tick in the percussion cap box that had lately been the
pinchbugs prison and the boys separated each feeling wealthier than
before

when tom reached the little isolated frame school house he strode in
briskly with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed he
hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business like
alacrity the master throned on high in his great splint bottom
arm chair was dozing lulled by the drowsy hum of study the
interruption roused him

thomas sawyer

tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full it meant trouble

sir

come up here now sir why are you late again as usual

tom was about to take refuge in a lie when he saw two long tails of
yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
sympathy of love and by that form was the only vacant place on the
girls side of the school house he instantly said

i stopped to talk with huckleberry finn

the masters pulse stood still and he stared helplessly the buzz of
study ceased the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
mind the master said

you you did what

stopped to talk with huckleberry finn

there was no mistaking the words

thomas sawyer this is the most astounding confession i have ever
listened to no mere ferule will answer for this offence take off your
jacket

the masters arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
notably diminished then the order followed

now sir go and sit with the girls and let this be a warning to you

the titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy but
in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe
of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
fortune he sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched
herself away from him with a toss of her head nudges and winks and
whispers traversed the room but tom sat still with his arms upon the
long low desk before him and seemed to study his book

by and by attention ceased from him and the accustomed school murmur
rose upon the dull air once more presently the boy began to steal
furtive glances at the girl she observed it made a mouth at him
and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute when she
cautiously faced around again a peach lay before her she thrust it
away tom gently put it back she thrust it away again but with less
animosity tom patiently returned it to its place then she let it
remain tom scrawled on his slate please take it i got more the
girl glanced at the words but made no sign now the boy began to draw
something on the slate hiding his work with his left hand for a time
the girl refused to notice but her human curiosity presently began
to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs the boy worked on
apparently unconscious the girl made a sort of non committal attempt
to see but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it at last she
gave in and hesitatingly whispered

let me see it

tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney then the girls
interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
else when it was finished she gazed a moment then whispered

its nice make a man

the artist erected a man in the front yard that resembled a derrick he
could have stepped over the house but the girl was not hypercritical
she was satisfied with the monster and whispered

its a beautiful man now make me coming along

tom drew an hour glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
the spreading fingers with a portentous fan the girl said

its ever so nice i wish i could draw

its easy whispered tom ill learn you

oh will you when

at noon do you go home to dinner

ill stay if you will

good thats a whack whats your name

becky thatcher whats yours oh i know its thomas sawyer

thats the name they lick me by im tom when im good you call me
tom will you

yes

now tom began to scrawl something on the slate hiding the words from
the girl but she was not backward this time she begged to see tom
said

oh it aint anything

yes it is

no it aint you dont want to see

yes i do indeed i do please let me

youll tell

no i wont deed and deed and double deed wont

you wont tell anybody at all ever as long as you live

no i wont ever tell any body now let me

oh you dont want to see

now that you treat me so i will see and she put her small hand
upon his and a little scuffle ensued tom pretending to resist in
earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
revealed i love you

oh you bad thing and she hit his hand a smart rap but reddened and
looked pleased nevertheless

just at this juncture the boy felt a slow fateful grip closing on his
ear and a steady lifting impulse in that wise he was borne across the
house and deposited in his own seat under a peppering fire of giggles
from the whole school then the master stood over him during a few awful
moments and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word but
although toms ear tingled his heart was jubilant

as the school quieted down tom made an honest effort to study but
the turmoil within him was too great in turn he took his place in the
reading class and made a botch of it then in the geography class and
turned lakes into mountains mountains into rivers and rivers into
continents till chaos was come again then in the spelling class and
got turned down by a succession of mere baby words till he brought
up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
ostentation for months




chapter vii

the harder tom tried to fasten his mind on his book the more his ideas
wandered so at last with a sigh and a yawn he gave it up it seemed
to him that the noon recess would never come the air was utterly dead
there was not a breath stirring it was the sleepiest of sleepy days
the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed
the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees away off in the
flaming sunshine cardiff hill lifted its soft green sides through a
shimmering veil of heat tinted with the purple of distance a few birds
floated on lazy wing high in the air no other living thing was visible
but some cows and they were asleep toms heart ached to be free or
else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time
his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
gratitude that was prayer though he did not know it then furtively
the percussion cap box came out he released the tick and put him on
the long flat desk the creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
amounted to prayer too at this moment but it was premature for when
he started thankfully to travel off tom turned him aside with a pin and
made him take a new direction

toms bosom friend sat next him suffering just as tom had been and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in
an instant this bosom friend was joe harper the two boys were sworn
friends all the week and embattled enemies on saturdays joe took a
pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner
the sport grew in interest momently soon tom said that they were
interfering with each other and neither getting the fullest benefit
of the tick so he put joes slate on the desk and drew a line down the
middle of it from top to bottom

now said he as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
ill let him alone but if you let him get away and get on my side
youre to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over

all right go ahead start him up

the tick escaped from tom presently and crossed the equator joe
harassed him awhile and then he got away and crossed back again this
change of base occurred often while one boy was worrying the tick with
absorbing interest the other would look on with interest as strong the
two heads bowed together over the slate and the two souls dead to all
things else at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe the
tick tried this that and the other course and got as excited and as
anxious as the boys themselves but time and again just as he would
have victory in his very grasp so to speak and toms fingers would
be twitching to begin joes pin would deftly head him off and keep
possession at last tom could stand it no longer the temptation was too
strong so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin joe was angry in
a moment said he

tom you let him alone

i only just want to stir him up a little joe

no sir it aint fair you just let him alone

blame it i aint going to stir him much

let him alone i tell you

i wont

you shall hes on my side of the line

look here joe harper whose is that tick

i dont care whose tick he is hes on my side of the line and you
shant touch him

well ill just bet i will though hes my tick and ill do what i
blame please with him or die

a tremendous whack came down on toms shoulders and its duplicate on
joes and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it the boys had been
too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them
he had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed
his bit of variety to it

when school broke up at noon tom flew to becky thatcher and whispered
in her ear

put on your bonnet and let on youre going home and when you get to
the corner give the rest of em the slip and turn down through the
lane and come back ill go the other way and come it over em the same
way

so the one went off with one group of scholars and the other with
another in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane and
when they reached the school they had it all to themselves then they
sat together with a slate before them and tom gave becky the pencil
and held her hand in his guiding it and so created another surprising
house when the interest in art began to wane the two fell to talking
tom was swimming in bliss he said

do you love rats

no i hate them

well i do too live ones but i mean dead ones to swing round your
head with a string

no i dont care for rats much anyway what i like is chewing gum

oh i should say so i wish i had some now

do you ive got some ill let you chew it awhile but you must give
it back to me

that was agreeable so they chewed it turn about and dangled their legs
against the bench in excess of contentment

was you ever at a circus said tom

yes and my pas going to take me again some time if im good

i been to the circus three or four times lots of times church aint
shucks to a circus theres things going on at a circus all the time
im going to be a clown in a circus when i grow up

oh are you that will be nice theyre so lovely all spotted up

yes thats so and they get slathers of money most a dollar a day ben
rogers says say becky was you ever engaged

whats that

why engaged to be married

no

would you like to

i reckon so i dont know what is it like

like why it aint like anything you only just tell a boy you wont
ever have anybody but him ever ever ever and then you kiss and thats
all anybody can do it

kiss what do you kiss for

why that you know is to well they always do that

everybody

why yes everybody thats in love with each other do you remember
what i wrote on the slate

ye yes

what was it

i shant tell you

shall i tell you

ye yes but some other time

no now

no not now to morrow

oh no now please becky ill whisper it ill whisper it ever so
easy

becky hesitating tom took silence for consent and passed his arm about
her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly with his mouth close to
her ear and then he added

now you whisper it to me just the same

she resisted for a while and then said

you turn your face away so you cant see and then i will but you
mustnt ever tell anybody will you tom now you wont will you

no indeed indeed i wont now becky

he turned his face away she bent timidly around till her breath stirred
his curls and whispered i love you

then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches
with tom after her and took refuge in a corner at last with her little
white apron to her face tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded

now becky its all done all over but the kiss dont you be afraid
of that it aint anything at all please becky and he tugged at her
apron and the hands

by and by she gave up and let her hands drop her face all glowing
with the struggle came up and submitted tom kissed the red lips and
said

now its all done becky and always after this you know you aint
ever to love anybody but me and you aint ever to marry anybody but me
ever never and forever will you

no ill never love anybody but you tom and ill never marry anybody
but you and you aint to ever marry anybody but me either

certainly of course thats part of it and always coming to school
or when were going home youre to walk with me when there aint
anybody looking and you choose me and i choose you at parties because
thats the way you do when youre engaged

its so nice i never heard of it before

oh its ever so gay why me and amy lawrence

the big eyes told tom his blunder and he stopped confused

oh tom then i aint the first youve ever been engaged to

the child began to cry tom said

oh dont cry becky i dont care for her any more

yes you do tom you know you do

tom tried to put his arm about her neck but she pushed him away and
turned her face to the wall and went on crying tom tried again with
soothing words in his mouth and was repulsed again then his pride was
up and he strode away and went outside he stood about restless and
uneasy for a while glancing at the door every now and then hoping
she would repent and come to find him but she did not then he began
to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong it was a hard struggle
with him to make new advances now but he nerved himself to it and
entered she was still standing back there in the corner sobbing with
her face to the wall toms heart smote him he went to her and stood a
moment not knowing exactly how to proceed then he said hesitatingly

becky i i dont care for anybody but you

no reply but sobs

becky pleadingly becky wont you say something

more sobs

tom got out his chiefest jewel a brass knob from the top of an andiron
and passed it around her so that she could see it and said

please becky wont you take it

she struck it to the floor then tom marched out of the house and over
the hills and far away to return to school no more that day presently
becky began to suspect she ran to the door he was not in sight she
flew around to the play yard he was not there then she called

tom come back tom

she listened intently but there was no answer she had no companions
but silence and loneliness so she sat down to cry again and upbraid
herself and by this time the scholars began to gather again and she
had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
of a long dreary aching afternoon with none among the strangers about
her to exchange sorrows with




chapter viii

tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
track of returning scholars and then fell into a moody jog he crossed
a small branch two or three times because of a prevailing juvenile
superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit half an hour later
he was disappearing behind the douglas mansion on the summit of cardiff
hill and the school house was hardly distinguishable away off in the
valley behind him he entered a dense wood picked his pathless way to
the centre of it and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak
there was not even a zephyr stirring the dead noonday heat had even
stilled the songs of the birds nature lay in a trance that was broken
by no sound but the occasional far off hammering of a wood pecker and
this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the
more profound the boys soul was steeped in melancholy his feelings
were in happy accord with his surroundings he sat long with his elbows
on his knees and his chin in his hands meditating it seemed to him
that life was but a trouble at best and he more than half envied jimmy
hodges so lately released it must be very peaceful he thought to lie
and slumber and dream forever and ever with the wind whispering through
the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave and
nothing to bother and grieve about ever any more if he only had a
clean sunday school record he could be willing to go and be done with
it all now as to this girl what had he done nothing he had meant
the best in the world and been treated like a dog like a very dog she
would be sorry some day maybe when it was too late ah if he could only
die temporarily

but the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained
shape long at a time tom presently began to drift insensibly back into
the concerns of this life again what if he turned his back now and
disappeared mysteriously what if he went away ever so far away into
unknown countries beyond the seas and never came back any more how
would she feel then the idea of being a clown recurred to him now only
to fill him with disgust for frivolity and jokes and spotted tights
were an offense when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic no he would be
a soldier and return after long years all war worn and illustrious
no better still he would join the indians and hunt buffaloes and go on
the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the
far west and away in the future come back a great chief bristling with
feathers hideous with paint and prance into sunday school some drowsy
summer morning with a blood curdling war whoop and sear the eyeballs
of all his companions with unappeasable envy but no there was
something gaudier even than this he would be a pirate that was it
now his future lay plain before him and glowing with unimaginable
splendor how his name would fill the world and make people shudder
how gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas in his long low
black hulled racer the spirit of the storm with his grisly flag flying
at the fore and at the zenith of his fame how he would suddenly appear
at the old village and stalk into church brown and weather beaten in
his black velvet doublet and trunks his great jack boots his crimson
sash his belt bristling with horse pistols his crime rusted cutlass
at his side his slouch hat with waving plumes his black flag unfurled
with the skull and crossbones on it and hear with swelling ecstasy
the whisperings its tom sawyer the pirate the black avenger of the
spanish main

yes it was settled his career was determined he would run away from
home and enter upon it he would start the very next morning therefore
he must now begin to get ready he would collect his resources together
he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of
it with his barlow knife he soon struck wood that sounded hollow he
put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively

what hasnt come here come whats here stay here

then he scraped away the dirt and exposed a pine shingle he took it
up and disclosed a shapely little treasure house whose bottom and sides
were of shingles in it lay a marble toms astonishment was bound less
he scratched his head with a perplexed air and said

well that beats anything

then he tossed the marble away pettishly and stood cogitating the
truth was that a superstition of his had failed here which he and
all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible if you buried
a marble with certain necessary incantations and left it alone a
fortnight and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
used you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered
themselves together there meantime no matter how widely they had been
separated but now this thing had actually and unquestionably failed
toms whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations he had
many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing
before it did not occur to him that he had tried it several times
before himself but could never find the hiding places afterward he
puzzled over the matter some time and finally decided that some witch
had interfered and broken the charm he thought he would satisfy himself
on that point so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
with a little funnel shaped depression in it he laid himself down and
put his mouth close to this depression and called

doodle bug doodle bug tell me what i want to know doodle bug
doodle bug tell me what i want to know

the sand began to work and presently a small black bug appeared for a
second and then darted under again in a fright

he dasnt tell so it was a witch that done it i just knowed it

he well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches so he
gave up discouraged but it occurred to him that he might as well have
the marble he had just thrown away and therefore he went and made a
patient search for it but he could not find it now he went back to his
treasure house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing
when he tossed the marble away then he took another marble from his
pocket and tossed it in the same way saying

brother go find your brother

he watched where it stopped and went there and looked but it must
have fallen short or gone too far so he tried twice more the last
repetition was successful the two marbles lay within a foot of each
other

just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
aisles of the forest tom flung off his jacket and trousers turned
a suspender into a belt raked away some brush behind the rotten log
disclosing a rude bow and arrow a lath sword and a tin trumpet and
in a moment had seized these things and bounded away barelegged
with fluttering shirt he presently halted under a great elm blew an
answering blast and then began to tiptoe and look warily out this way
and that he said cautiously to an imaginary company

hold my merry men keep hid till i blow

now appeared joe harper as airily clad and elaborately armed as tom
tom called

hold who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass

guy of guisborne wants no mans pass who art thou that that

dares to hold such language said tom prompting for they talked by
the book from memory

who art thou that dares to hold such language

i indeed i am robin hood as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know

then art thou indeed that famous outlaw right gladly will i dispute
with thee the passes of the merry wood have at thee

they took their lath swords dumped their other traps on the ground
struck a fencing attitude foot to foot and began a grave careful
combat two up and two down presently tom said

now if youve got the hang go it lively

so they went it lively panting and perspiring with the work by and
by tom shouted

fall fall why dont you fall

i shant why dont you fall yourself youre getting the worst of
it

why that aint anything i cant fall that aint the way it is in the
book the book says then with one back handed stroke he slew poor guy
of guisborne youre to turn around and let me hit you in the back

there was no getting around the authorities so joe turned received the
whack and fell

now said joe getting up you got to let me kill you thats
fair

why i cant do that it aint in the book

well its blamed mean thats all

well say joe you can be friar tuck or much the millers son and lam
me with a quarter staff or ill be the sheriff of nottingham and you be
robin hood a little while and kill me

this was satisfactory and so these adventures were carried out then
tom became robin hood again and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
bleed his strength away through his neglected wound and at last joe
representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws dragged him sadly forth
gave his bow into his feeble hands and tom said where this arrow
falls there bury poor robin hood under the greenwood tree then he
shot the arrow and fell back and would have died but he lit on a nettle
and sprang up too gaily for a corpse

the boys dressed themselves hid their accoutrements and went off
grieving that there were no outlaws any more and wondering what modern
civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss
they said they would rather be outlaws a year in sherwood forest than
president of the united states forever




chapter ix

at half past nine that night tom and sid were sent to bed as usual
they said their prayers and sid was soon asleep tom lay awake and
waited in restless impatience when it seemed to him that it must be
nearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten this was despair he
would have tossed and fidgeted as his nerves demanded but he was
afraid he might wake sid so he lay still and stared up into the dark
everything was dismally still by and by out of the stillness little
scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves the ticking
of the clock began to bring itself into notice old beams began to crack
mysteriously the stairs creaked faintly evidently spirits were abroad
a measured muffled snore issued from aunt pollys chamber and now the
tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate
began next the ghastly ticking of a death watch in the wall at the
beds head made tom shudder it meant that somebodys days were numbered
then the howl of a far off dog rose on the night air and was answered
by a fainter howl from a remoter distance tom was in an agony at last
he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun he began to
doze in spite of himself the clock chimed eleven but he did not hear
it and then there came mingling with his half formed dreams a most
melancholy caterwauling the raising of a neighboring window disturbed
him a cry of scat you devil and the crash of an empty bottle
against the back of his aunts woodshed brought him wide awake and a
single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping
along the roof of the ell on all fours he meowd with caution once
or twice as he went then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence
to the ground huckleberry finn was there with his dead cat the boys
moved off and disappeared in the gloom at the end of half an hour they
were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard

it was a graveyard of the old fashioned western kind it was on a hill
about a mile and a half from the village it had a crazy board fence
around it which leaned inward in places and outward the rest of the
time but stood upright nowhere grass and weeds grew rank over the
whole cemetery all the old graves were sunken in there was not a
tombstone on the place round topped worm eaten boards staggered over
the graves leaning for support and finding none sacred to the memory
of so and so had been painted on them once but it could no longer have
been read on the most of them now even if there had been light

a faint wind moaned through the trees and tom feared it might be the
spirits of the dead complaining at being disturbed the boys talked
little and only under their breath for the time and the place and the
pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits they found the
sharp new heap they were seeking and ensconced themselves within the
protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of
the grave

then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time the hooting of
a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness toms
reflections grew oppressive he must force some talk so he said in a
whisper

hucky do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here

huckleberry whispered

i wisht i knowed its awful solemn like aint it

i bet it is

there was a considerable pause while the boys canvassed this matter
inwardly then tom whispered

say hucky do you reckon hoss williams hears us talking

o course he does least his sperrit does

tom after a pause

i wish id said mister williams but i never meant any harm everybody
calls him hoss

a body cant be too particlar how they talk bout these yer dead
people tom

this was a damper and conversation died again

presently tom seized his comrades arm and said

sh

what is it tom and the two clung together with beating hearts

sh there tis again didnt you hear it

i

there now you hear it

lord tom theyre coming theyre coming sure whatll we do

i dono think theyll see us

oh tom they can see in the dark same as cats i wisht i hadnt
come

oh dont be afeard i dont believe theyll bother us we aint doing
any harm if we keep perfectly still maybe they wont notice us at
all

ill try to tom but lord im all of a shiver

listen

the boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed a muffled
sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard

look see there whispered tom what is it

its devil fire oh tom this is awful

some vague figures approached through the gloom swinging an
old fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light presently huckleberry whispered with a
shudder

its the devils sure enough three of em lordy tom were goners
can you pray

ill try but dont you be afeard they aint going to hurt us now i
lay me down to sleep i

sh

what is it huck

theyre humans one of em is anyway one of ems old muff potters

come again now theyre hot cold again hot again red hot theyre
pinted right this time say huck i know another o them voices its
injun joe

thats so that murderin half breed id druther they was devils a dern
sight what kin they be up to

the whisper died wholly out now for the three men had reached the
grave and stood within a few feet of the boys hiding place

here it is said the third voice and the owner of it held the lantern
up and revealed the face of young doctor robinson

potter and injun joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple
of shovels on it they cast down their load and began to open the grave
the doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat
down with his back against one of the elm trees he was so close the
boys could have touched him

hurry men he said in a low voice the moon might come out at any
moment

they growled a response and went on digging for some time there was no
noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of
mould and gravel it was very monotonous finally a spade struck upon
the coffin with a dull woody accent and within another minute or two
the men had hoisted it out on the ground they pried off the lid with
their shovels got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground the
moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face
the barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it covered with a
blanket and bound to its place with the rope potter took out a large
spring knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said

now the cussed things ready sawbones and youll just out with
another five or here she stays

thats the talk said injun joe

look here what does this mean said the doctor you required your
pay in advance and ive paid you

yes and you done more than that said injun joe approaching the
doctor who was now standing five years ago you drove me away from
your fathers kitchen one night when i come to ask for something to
eat and you said i warnt there for any good and when i swore id get
even with you if it took a hundred years your father had me jailed for
a vagrant did you think id forget the injun blood aint in me for
nothing and now ive got you and you got to settle you know

he was threatening the doctor with his fist in his face by this time
the doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground
potter dropped his knife and exclaimed

here now dont you hit my pard and the next moment he had grappled
with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main
trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels injun joe
sprang to his feet his eyes flaming with passion snatched up potters
knife and went creeping catlike and stooping round and round about
the combatants seeking an opportunity all at once the doctor flung
himself free seized the heavy headboard of williams grave and felled
potter to the earth with it and in the same instant the half breed saw
his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young mans breast he
reeled and fell partly upon potter flooding him with his blood and in
the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the
two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark

presently when the moon emerged again injun joe was standing over the
two forms contemplating them the doctor murmured inarticulately gave
a long gasp or two and was still the half breed muttered

that score is settled damn you

then he robbed the body after which he put the fatal knife in potters
open right hand and sat down on the dismantled coffin three four five
minutes passed and then potter began to stir and moan his hand closed
upon the knife he raised it glanced at it and let it fall with a
shudder then he sat up pushing the body from him and gazed at it and
then around him confusedly his eyes met joes

lord how is this joe he said

its a dirty business said joe without moving

what did you do it for

i i never done it

look here that kind of talk wont wash

potter trembled and grew white

i thought id got sober id no business to drink to night but its
in my head yet worsen when we started here im all in a muddle
cant recollect anything of it hardly tell me joe honest now
old feller did i do it joe i never meant to pon my soul and honor i
never meant to joe tell me how it was joe oh its awful and him so
young and promising

why you two was scuffling and he fetched you one with the headboard
and you fell flat and then up you come all reeling and staggering
like and snatched the knife and jammed it into him just as he fetched
you another awful clip and here youve laid as dead as a wedge til
now

oh i didnt know what i was a doing i wish i may die this minute if i
did it was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement i reckon
i never used a weepon in my life before joe ive fought but never
with weepons theyll all say that joe dont tell say you wont tell
joe thats a good feller i always liked you joe and stood up for you
too dont you remember you wont tell will you joe and the
poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer and
clasped his appealing hands

no youve always been fair and square with me muff potter and i
wont go back on you there now thats as fair as a man can say

oh joe youre an angel ill bless you for this the longest day i
live and potter began to cry

come now thats enough of that this aint any time for blubbering
you be off yonder way and ill go this move now and dont leave any
tracks behind you

potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run the half breed
stood looking after him he muttered

if hes as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
had the look of being he wont think of the knife till hes gone so
far hell be afraid to come back after it to such a place by
himself chicken heart

two or three minutes later the murdered man the blanketed corpse the
lidless coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but the
moons the stillness was complete again too




chapter x

the two boys flew on and on toward the village speechless with
horror they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time
apprehensively as if they feared they might be followed every stump
that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy and made them
catch their breath and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
near the village the barking of the aroused watch dogs seemed to give
wings to their feet

if we can only get to the old tannery before we break down whispered
tom in short catches between breaths i cant stand it much longer

huckleberrys hard pantings were his only reply and the boys fixed
their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it
they gained steadily on it and at last breast to breast they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows beyond by and by their pulses slowed down and tom whispered

huckleberry what do you reckonll come of this

if doctor robinson dies i reckon hangingll come of it

do you though

why i know it tom

tom thought a while then he said

wholl tell we

what are you talking about spose something happened and injun joe
didnt hang why hed kill us some time or other just as dead sure
as were a laying here

thats just what i was thinking to myself huck

if anybody tells let muff potter do it if hes fool enough hes
generally drunk enough

tom said nothing went on thinking presently he whispered

huck muff potter dont know it how can he tell

whats the reason he dont know it

because hed just got that whack when injun joe done it dyou reckon
he could see anything dyou reckon he knowed anything

by hokey thats so tom

and besides look a here maybe that whack done for him

no taint likely tom he had liquor in him i could see that and
besides he always has well when paps full you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldnt phase him he says so
his own self so its the same with muff potter of course but if a man
was dead sober i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him i dono

after another reflective silence tom said

hucky you sure you can keep mum

tom we got to keep mum you know that that injun devil wouldnt
make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats if we was to squeak
bout this and they didnt hang him now look a here tom less take
and swear to one another thats what we got to do swear to keep mum

im agreed its the best thing would you just hold hands and swear
that we

oh no that wouldnt do for this thats good enough for little
rubbishy common things specially with gals cuz they go back on you
anyway and blab if they get in a huff but there orter be writing bout
a big thing like this and blood

toms whole being applauded this idea it was deep and dark and awful
the hour the circumstances the surroundings were in keeping with it
he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon light took a
little fragment of red keel out of his pocket got the moon on
his work and painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slow
down stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth and letting up the
pressure on the up strokes see next page

huck finn and tom sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they
wish they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot

huckleberry was filled with admiration of toms facility in writing and
the sublimity of his language he at once took a pin from his lapel and
was going to prick his flesh but tom said

hold on dont do that a pins brass it might have verdigrease on
it

whats verdigrease

its pison thats what it is you just swaller some of it once youll
see

so tom unwound the thread from one of his needles and each boy pricked
the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood in time after
many squeezes tom managed to sign his initials using the ball of his
little finger for a pen then he showed huckleberry how to make an h and
an f and the oath was complete they buried the shingle close to the
wall with some dismal ceremonies and incantations and the fetters
that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
away

a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
building now but they did not notice it

tom whispered huckleberry does this keep us from ever
telling always

of course it does it dont make any difference what happens we got
to keep mum wed drop down dead dont you know that

yes i reckon thats so

they continued to whisper for some little time presently a dog set up
a long lugubrious howl just outside within ten feet of them the boys
clasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright

which of us does he mean gasped huckleberry

i dono peep through the crack quick

no you tom

i cant i cant do it huck

please tom there tis again

oh lordy im thankful whispered tom i know his voice its bull
harbison

if mr harbison owned a slave named bull tom would have spoken of
him as harbisons bull but a son or a dog of that name was bull
harbison

oh thats good i tell you tom i was most scared to death id a bet
anything it was a stray dog

the dog howled again the boys hearts sank once more

oh my that aint no bull harbison whispered huckleberry do
tom

tom quaking with fear yielded and put his eye to the crack his
whisper was hardly audible when he said

oh huck its a stray dog

quick tom quick who does he mean

huck he must mean us both were right together

oh tom i reckon were goners i reckon there aint no mistake bout
where ill go to i been so wicked

dad fetch it this comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
fellers told not to do i might a been good like sid if id a
tried but no i wouldnt of course but if ever i get off this time
i lay ill just waller in sunday schools and tom began to snuffle a
little

you bad and huckleberry began to snuffle too consound it tom
sawyer youre just old pie long side o what i am oh lordy
lordy lordy i wisht i only had half your chance

tom choked off and whispered

look hucky look hes got his back to us

hucky looked with joy in his heart

well he has by jingoes did he before

yes he did but i like a fool never thought oh this is bully you
know now who can he mean

the howling stopped tom pricked up his ears

sh whats that he whispered

sounds like like hogs grunting no its somebody snoring tom

that is it where bouts is it huck

i bleeve its down at tother end sounds so anyway pap used to sleep
there sometimes long with the hogs but laws bless you he just lifts
things when he snores besides i reckon he aint ever coming back to
this town any more

the spirit of adventure rose in the boys souls once more

hucky do you dast to go if i lead

i dont like to much tom spose its injun joe

tom quailed but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped so they went tiptoeing stealthily down
the one behind the other when they had got to within five steps of the
snorer tom stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snap the man
moaned writhed a little and his face came into the moonlight it was
muff potter the boys hearts had stood still and their hopes too
when the man moved but their fears passed away now they tip toed out
through the broken weather boarding and stopped at a little distance
to exchange a parting word that long lugubrious howl rose on the night
air again they turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where potter was lying and facing potter with his nose
pointing heavenward

oh geeminy its him exclaimed both boys in a breath

say tom they say a stray dog come howling around johnny millers
house bout midnight as much as two weeks ago and a whippoorwill come
in and lit on the banisters and sung the very same evening and there
aint anybody dead there yet

well i know that and suppose there aint didnt gracie miller fall
in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next saturday

yes but she aint dead and whats more shes getting better too

all right you wait and see shes a goner just as dead sure as muff
potters a goner thats what the niggers say and they know all about
these kind of things huck

then they separated cogitating when tom crept in at his bedroom window
the night was almost spent he undressed with excessive caution and
fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade he
was not aware that the gently snoring sid was awake and had been so for
an hour

when tom awoke sid was dressed and gone there was a late look in the
light a late sense in the atmosphere he was startled why had he not
been called persecuted till he was up as usual the thought filled
him with bodings within five minutes he was dressed and down stairs
feeling sore and drowsy the family were still at table but they had
finished breakfast there was no voice of rebuke but there were averted
eyes there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill
to the culprits heart he sat down and tried to seem gay but it
was up hill work it roused no smile no response and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths

after breakfast his aunt took him aside and tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be flogged but it was not so his aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so
and finally told him to go on and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
with sorrow to the grave for it was no use for her to try any more
this was worse than a thousand whippings and toms heart was sorer now
than his body he cried he pleaded for forgiveness promised to reform
over and over again and then received his dismissal feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence

he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
sid and so the latters prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary he moped to school gloomy and sad and took his flogging
along with joe harper for playing hookey the day before with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go
his elbow was pressing against some hard substance after a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object with
a sigh it was in a paper he unrolled it a long lingering colossal
sigh followed and his heart broke it was his brass andiron knob

this final feather broke the camels back




chapter xi

close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly news no need of the as yet un dreamed of telegraph
the tale flew from man to man from group to group from house to house
with little less than telegraphic speed of course the schoolmaster gave
holi day for that afternoon the town would have thought strangely of
him if he had not

a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to muff potter so the story ran and
it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing himself
in the branch about one or two oclock in the morning and that potter
had at once sneaked off suspicious circumstances especially the washing
which was not a habit with potter it was also said that the town had
been ransacked for this murderer the public are not slow in the
matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict but that he
could not be found horsemen had departed down all the roads in every
direction and the sheriff was confident that he would be captured
before night

all the town was drifting toward the graveyard toms heartbreak
vanished and he joined the procession not because he would not
a thousand times rather go anywhere else but because an awful
unaccountable fascination drew him on arrived at the dreadful place he
wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle
it seemed to him an age since he was there before somebody pinched
his arm he turned and his eyes met huckleberrys then both looked
elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual glance but everybody was talking and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before them

poor fellow poor young fellow this ought to be a lesson to grave
robbers muff potterll hang for this if they catch him this was the
drift of remark and the minister said it was a judgment his hand is
here

now tom shivered from head to heel for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of injun joe at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle
and voices shouted its him its him hes coming himself

who who from twenty voices

muff potter

hallo hes stopped look out hes turning dont let him get away

people in the branches of the trees over toms head said he wasnt
trying to get away he only looked doubtful and perplexed

infernal impudence said a bystander wanted to come and take a quiet
look at his work i reckon didnt expect any company

the crowd fell apart now and the sheriff came through ostentatiously
leading potter by the arm the poor fellows face was haggard and
his eyes showed the fear that was upon him when he stood before the
murdered man he shook as with a palsy and he put his face in his hands
and burst into tears

i didnt do it friends he sobbed pon my word and honor i never
done it

whos accused you shouted a voice

this shot seemed to carry home potter lifted his face and looked around
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes he saw injun joe and
exclaimed

oh injun joe you promised me youd never

is that your knife and it was thrust before him by the sheriff

potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
ground then he said

something told me t if i didnt come back and get he shuddered then
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said tell em
joe tell em it aint any use any more

then huckleberry and tom stood dumb and staring and heard the
stony hearted liar reel off his serene statement they expecting every
moment that the clear sky would deliver gods lightnings upon his head
and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed and when he had
finished and still stood alive and whole their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoners life faded and
vanished away for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that

why didnt you leave what did you want to come here for somebody
said

i couldnt help it i couldnt help it potter moaned i wanted to
run away but i couldnt seem to come anywhere but here and he fell to
sobbing again

injun joe repeated his statement just as calmly a few minutes
afterward on the inquest under oath and the boys seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld were confirmed in their belief that
joe had sold himself to the devil he was now become to them the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his face

they inwardly resolved to watch him nights when opportunity should
offer in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master

injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little the boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction but they were
disappointed for more than one villager remarked

it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it

toms fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this and at breakfast one morning sid said

tom you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time

tom blanched and dropped his eyes

its a bad sign said aunt polly gravely what you got on your mind
tom

nothing nothing t i know of but the boys hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee

and you do talk such stuff sid said last night you said its
blood its blood thats what it is you said that over and over
and you said dont torment me so ill tell tell what what is it
youll tell

everything was swimming before tom there is no telling what might have
happened now but luckily the concern passed out of aunt pollys face
and she came to toms relief without knowing it she said

sho its that dreadful murder i dream about it most every night
myself sometimes i dream its me that done it

mary said she had been affected much the same way sid seemed satisfied
tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could and after
that he complained of toothache for a week and tied up his jaws every
night he never knew that sid lay nightly watching and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a time and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
again toms distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
irksome and was discarded if sid really managed to make anything out of
toms disjointed mutterings he kept it to himself

it seemed to tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead cats and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind
sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises
he noticed too that tom never acted as a witness and that was strange
and sid did not overlook the fact that tom even showed a marked aversion
to these inquests and always avoided them when he could sid marvelled
but said nothing however even inquests went out of vogue at last and
ceased to torture toms conscience

every day or two during this time of sorrow tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of the
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the village and no guards were afforded for it indeed it
was seldom occupied these offerings greatly helped to ease toms
conscience

the villagers had a strong desire to tar and feather injun joe and ride
him on a rail for body snatching but so formidable was his character
that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
matter so it was dropped he had been careful to begin both of his
inquest statements with the fight without confessing the grave robbery
that preceded it therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
the courts at present




chapter xii

one of the reasons why toms mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
itself about becky thatcher had stopped coming to school tom had
struggled with his pride a few days and tried to whistle her down the
wind but failed he began to find himself hanging around her fathers
house nights and feeling very miserable she was ill what if she
should die there was distraction in the thought he no longer took an
interest in war nor even in piracy the charm of life was gone there
was nothing but dreariness left he put his hoop away and his bat
there was no joy in them any more his aunt was concerned she began to
try all manner of remedies on him she was one of those people who
are infatuated with patent medicines and all new fangled methods of
producing health or mending it she was an inveterate experimenter in
these things when something fresh in this line came out she was in a
fever right away to try it not on herself for she was never ailing
but on anybody else that came handy she was a subscriber for all the
health periodicals and phrenological frauds and the solemn ignorance
they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils all the rot they
contained about ventilation and how to go to bed and how to get up
and what to eat and what to drink and how much exercise to take and
what frame of mind to keep ones self in and what sort of clothing
to wear was all gospel to her and she never observed that her
health journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
had recommended the month before she was as simple hearted and honest
as the day was long and so she was an easy victim she gathered
together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines and thus armed
with death went about on her pale horse metaphorically speaking with
hell following after but she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise to the suffering
neighbors

the water treatment was new now and toms low condition was a windfall
to her she had him out at daylight every morning stood him up in the
wood shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water then she scrubbed
him down with a towel like a file and so brought him to then she
rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
sweated his soul clean and the yellow stains of it came through his
pores as tom said

yet notwithstanding all this the boy grew more and more melancholy and
pale and dejected she added hot baths sitz baths shower baths and
plunges the boy remained as dismal as a hearse she began to assist the
water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister plasters she calculated his
capacity as she would a jugs and filled him up every day with quack
cure alls

tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time this phase
filled the old ladys heart with consternation this indifference must
be broken up at any cost now she heard of pain killer for the first
time she ordered a lot at once she tasted it and was filled with
gratitude it was simply fire in a liquid form she dropped the water
treatment and everything else and pinned her faith to pain killer
she gave tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
result her troubles were instantly at rest her soul at peace again
for the indifference was broken up the boy could not have shown a
wilder heartier interest if she had built a fire under him

tom felt that it was time to wake up this sort of life might be
romantic enough in his blighted condition but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it so he
thought over various plans for relief and finally hit upon that of
professing to be fond of pain killer he asked for it so often that he
became a nuisance and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
quit bothering her if it had been sid she would have had no misgivings
to alloy her delight but since it was tom she watched the bottle
clandestinely she found that the medicine did really diminish but it
did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
the sitting room floor with it

one day tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunts yellow
cat came along purring eyeing the teaspoon avariciously and begging
for a taste tom said

dont ask for it unless you want it peter

but peter signified that he did want it

you better make sure

peter was sure

now youve asked for it and ill give it to you because there aint
anything mean about me but if you find you dont like it you mustnt
blame anybody but your own self

peter was agreeable so tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the pain killer peter sprang a couple of yards in the air and then
delivered a war whoop and set off round and round the room banging
against furniture upsetting flower pots and making general havoc next
he rose on his hind feet and pranced around in a frenzy of enjoyment
with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
unappeasable happiness then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his path aunt polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double summersets deliver a final mighty hurrah
and sail through the open window carrying the rest of the flower pots
with him the old lady stood petrified with astonishment peering over
her glasses tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter

tom what on earth ails that cat

i dont know aunt gasped the boy

why i never see anything like it what did make him act so

deed i dont know aunt polly cats always act so when theyre having a
good time

they do do they there was something in the tone that made tom
apprehensive

yesm that is i believe they do

you do

yesm

the old lady was bending down tom watching with interest emphasized
by anxiety too late he divined her drift the handle of the telltale
tea spoon was visible under the bed valance aunt polly took it held it
up tom winced and dropped his eyes aunt polly raised him by the usual
handle his ear and cracked his head soundly with her thimble

now sir what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so for

i done it out of pity for him because he hadnt any aunt

hadnt any aunt you numskull what has that got to do with it

heaps because if hed had one shed a burnt him out herself shed a
roasted his bowels out of him thout any more feeling than if he was a
human

aunt polly felt a sudden pang of remorse this was putting the thing in
a new light what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy too
she began to soften she felt sorry her eyes watered a little and she
put her hand on toms head and said gently

i was meaning for the best tom and tom it did do you good

tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
through his gravity

i know you was meaning for the best aunty and so was i with peter it
done him good too i never see him get around so since

oh go long with you tom before you aggravate me again and you try
and see if you cant be a good boy for once and you neednt take any
more medicine

tom reached school ahead of time it was noticed that this strange thing
had been occurring every day latterly and now as usual of late
he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
comrades he was sick he said and he looked it he tried to seem to
be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking down the road
presently jeff thatcher hove in sight and toms face lighted he gazed
a moment and then turned sorrowfully away when jeff arrived tom
accosted him and led up warily to opportunities for remark about
becky but the giddy lad never could see the bait tom watched and
watched hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight and hating the
owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one at last frocks
ceased to appear and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps he entered
the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer then one more frock passed
in at the gate and toms heart gave a great bound the next instant he
was out and going on like an indian yelling laughing chasing boys
jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb throwing handsprings
standing on his head doing all the heroic things he could conceive of
and keeping a furtive eye out all the while to see if becky thatcher
was noticing but she seemed to be unconscious of it all she never
looked could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there
he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity came war whooping
around snatched a boys cap hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse
broke through a group of boys tumbling them in every direction and
fell sprawling himself under beckys nose almost upsetting her and
she turned with her nose in the air and he heard her say mf some
people think theyre mighty smart always showing off

toms cheeks burned he gathered himself up and sneaked off crushed and
crestfallen




chapter xiii

toms mind was made up now he was gloomy and desperate he was a
forsaken friendless boy he said nobody loved him when they found out
what they had driven him to perhaps they would be sorry he had tried
to do right and get along but they would not let him since nothing
would do them but to be rid of him let it be so and let them blame
him for the consequences why shouldnt they what right had the
friendless to complain yes they had forced him to it at last he would
lead a life of crime there was no choice

by this time he was far down meadow lane and the bell for school to
take up tinkled faintly upon his ear he sobbed now to think he
should never never hear that old familiar sound any more it was very
hard but it was forced on him since he was driven out into the cold
world he must submit but he forgave them then the sobs came thick and
fast

just at this point he met his souls sworn comrade joe
harper hard eyed and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
heart plainly here were two souls with but a single thought tom
wiping his eyes with his sleeve began to blubber out something about
a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to return and ended by hoping
that joe would not forget him

but it transpired that this was a request which joe had just been going
to make of tom and had come to hunt him up for that purpose his mother
had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
knew nothing about it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
him to go if she felt that way there was nothing for him to do but
succumb he hoped she would be happy and never regret having driven her
poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die

as the two boys walked sorrowing along they made a new compact to stand
by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
them of their troubles then they began to lay their plans joe was for
being a hermit and living on crusts in a remote cave and dying
some time of cold and want and grief but after listening to tom he
conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of
crime and so he consented to be a pirate

three miles below st petersburg at a point where the mississippi river
was a trifle over a mile wide there was a long narrow wooded island
with a shallow bar at the head of it and this offered well as a
rendezvous it was not inhabited it lay far over toward the further
shore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest so jacksons
island was chosen who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them then they hunted up huckleberry finn
and he joined them promptly for all careers were one to him he was
indifferent they presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
river bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour which was
midnight there was a small log raft there which they meant to capture
each would bring hooks and lines and such provision as he could steal
in the most dark and mysterious way as became outlaws and before the
afternoon was done they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hear something all
who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum and wait

about midnight tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting place it was starlight and very still the mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest tom listened a moment but no sound disturbed the
quiet then he gave a low distinct whistle it was answered from under
the bluff tom whistled twice more these signals were answered in the
same way then a guarded voice said

who goes there

tom sawyer the black avenger of the spanish main name your names

huck finn the red handed and joe harper the terror of the seas tom
had furnished these titles from his favorite literature

tis well give the countersign

two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night

blood

then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort there was
an easy comfortable path along the shore under the bluff but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate

the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon and had about worn
himself out with getting it there finn the red handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half cured leaf tobacco and had also brought
a few corn cobs to make pipes with but none of the pirates smoked or
chewed but himself the black avenger of the spanish main said it
would never do to start without some fire that was a wise thought
matches were hardly known there in that day they saw a fire smouldering
upon a great raft a hundred yards above and they went stealthily
thither and helped themselves to a chunk they made an imposing
adventure of it saying hist every now and then and suddenly
halting with finger on lip moving with hands on imaginary dagger hilts
and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foe stirred to let
him have it to the hilt because dead men tell no tales they knew
well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying
in stores or having a spree but still that was no excuse for their
conducting this thing in an unpiratical way

they shoved off presently tom in command huck at the after oar and
joe at the forward tom stood amidships gloomy browed and with folded
arms and gave his orders in a low stern whisper

luff and bring her to the wind

aye aye sir

steady steady y y y

steady it is sir

let her go off a point

point it is sir

as the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid stream
it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
style and were not intended to mean anything in particular

what sails she carrying

courses topsls and flying jib sir

send the ryals up lay out aloft there half a dozen of
ye foretopmaststunsl lively now

aye aye sir

shake out that maintogalansl sheets and braces now my hearties

aye aye sir

hellum a lee hard a port stand by to meet her when she comes port
port now men with a will stead y y y

steady it is sir

the raft drew beyond the middle of the river the boys pointed her head
right and then lay on their oars the river was not high so there was
not more than a two or three mile current hardly a word was said during
the next three quarters of an hour now the raft was passing before
the distant town two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay
peacefully sleeping beyond the vague vast sweep of star gemmed water
unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening the black
avenger stood still with folded arms looking his last upon the scene
of his former joys and his later sufferings and wishing she could see
him now abroad on the wild sea facing peril and death with dauntless
heart going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips it was but
a small strain on his imagination to remove jacksons island beyond
eye shot of the village and so he looked his last with a broken and
satisfied heart the other pirates were looking their last too and
they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
them out of the range of the island but they discovered the danger in
time and made shift to avert it about two oclock in the morning the
raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island
and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight part
of the little rafts belongings consisted of an old sail and this they
spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions
but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather as
became outlaws

they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the forest and then cooked some bacon in
the frying pan for supper and used up half of the corn pone stock
they had brought it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild
free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island
far from the haunts of men and they said they never would return to
civilization the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree trunks of their forest temple and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning vines

when the last crisp slice of bacon was gone and the last allowance
of corn pone devoured the boys stretched themselves out on the grass
filled with contentment they could have found a cooler place but
they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
campfire

aint it gay said joe

its nuts said tom what would the boys say if they could see us

say well theyd just die to be here hey hucky

i reckon so said huckleberry anyways im suited i dont want
nothing bettern this i dont ever get enough to eat genally and here
they cant come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so

its just the life for me said tom you dont have to get up
mornings and you dont have to go to school and wash and all that
blame foolishness you see a pirate dont have to do anything joe
when hes ashore but a hermit he has to be praying considerable and
then he dont have any fun anyway all by himself that way

oh yes thats so said joe but i hadnt thought much about it you
know id a good deal rather be a pirate now that ive tried it

you see said tom people dont go much on hermits nowadays like
they used to in old times but a pirates always respected and
a hermits got to sleep on the hardest place he can find and put
sackcloth and ashes on his head and stand out in the rain and

what does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for inquired huck

i dono but theyve got to do it hermits always do youd have to do
that if you was a hermit

dernd if i would said huck

well what would you do

i dono but i wouldnt do that

why huck youd have to howd you get around it

why i just wouldnt stand it id run away

run away well you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit youd be
a disgrace

the red handed made no response being better employed he had finished
gouging out a cob and now he fitted a weed stem to it loaded it with
tobacco and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
fragrant smoke he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment the
other pirates envied him this majestic vice and secretly resolved to
acquire it shortly presently huck said

what does pirates have to do

tom said

oh they have just a bully time take ships and burn them and get the
money and bury it in awful places in their island where theres ghosts
and things to watch it and kill everybody in the ships make em walk a
plank

and they carry the women to the island said joe they dont kill the
women

no assented tom they dont kill the women theyre too noble and
the womens always beautiful too

and dont they wear the bulliest clothes oh no all gold and silver
and dimonds said joe with enthusiasm

who said huck

why the pirates

huck scanned his own clothing forlornly

i reckon i aint dressed fitten for a pirate said he with a
regretful pathos in his voice but i aint got none but these

but the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough
after they should have begun their adventures they made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe

gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs the pipe dropped from the fingers of the
red handed and he slept the sleep of the conscience free and the weary
the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main had
more difficulty in getting to sleep they said their prayers inwardly
and lying down since there was nobody there with authority to make them
kneel and recite aloud in truth they had a mind not to say them at
all but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that lest they
might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven then at
once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep but an
intruder came now that would not down it was conscience they began
to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away and
next they thought of the stolen meat and then the real torture came
they tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had
purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times but conscience was not
to be appeased by such thin plausibilities it seemed to them in the
end that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking
sweetmeats was only hooking while taking bacon and hams and such
valuables was plain simple stealing and there was a command against that
in the bible so they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in
the business their piracies should not again be sullied with the
crime of stealing then conscience granted a truce and these curiously
inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep




chapter xiv

when tom awoke in the morning he wondered where he was he sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around then he comprehended it was the cool
gray dawn and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
deep pervading calm and silence of the woods not a leaf stirred not
a sound obtruded upon great natures meditation beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and grasses a white layer of ashes covered the fire
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air joe and huck
still slept

now far away in the woods a bird called another answered presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was heard gradually the cool dim gray
of the morning whitened and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested itself the marvel of nature shaking off sleep and going
to work unfolded itself to the musing boy a little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf lifting two thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and sniffing around then proceeding again for he
was measuring tom said and when the worm approached him of its own
accord he sat as still as a stone with his hopes rising and falling
by turns as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon toms leg and
began a journey over him his whole heart was glad for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform now a procession of ants appeared
from nowhere in particular and went about their labors one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms
and lugged it straight up a tree trunk a brown spotted lady bug climbed
the dizzy height of a grass blade and tom bent down close to it and
said lady bug lady bug fly away home your house is on fire your
childrens alone and she took wing and went off to see about it which
did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon its simplicity
more than once a tumblebug came next heaving sturdily at its ball and
tom touched the creature to see it shut its legs against its body
and pretend to be dead the birds were fairly rioting by this time a
catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over toms head and trilled
out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment then
a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and stopped on a twig
almost within the boys reach cocked his head to one side and eyed the
strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirrel and a big fellow
of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up at intervals to
inspect and chatter at the boys for the wild things had probably never
seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not
all nature was wide awake and stirring now long lances of sunlight
pierced down through the dense foliage far and near and a few
butterflies came fluttering upon the scene

tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with
a shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
sandbar they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of water a vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this only
gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and civilization

they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed glad hearted and
ravenous and they soon had the camp fire blazing up again huck found a
spring of clear cold water close by and the boys made cups of broad oak
or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such a wildwood
charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee while joe
was slicing bacon for breakfast tom and huck asked him to hold on a
minute they stepped to a promising nook in the river bank and threw in
their lines almost immediately they had reward joe had not had time
to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass
a couple of sun perch and a small catfish provisions enough for quite a
family they fried the fish with the bacon and were astonished for
no fish had ever seemed so delicious before they did not know that the
quicker a fresh water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
he is and they reflected little upon what a sauce open air sleeping
open air exercise bathing and a large ingredient of hunger make too

they lay around in the shade after breakfast while huck had a smoke
and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition they
tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush
among solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of grape vines now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers

they found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be
astonished at they discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
wide they took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the middle
of the afternoon when they got back to camp they were too hungry to
stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham and then threw
themselves down in the shade to talk but the talk soon began to drag
and then died the stillness the solemnity that brooded in the woods
and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon the spirits of the boys
they fell to thinking a sort of undefined longing crept upon them this
took dim shape presently it was budding homesickness even finn the
red handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads but they
were all ashamed of their weakness and none was brave enough to speak
his thought

for some time now the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note of but now this mysterious sound
became more pronounced and forced a recognition the boys started
glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude there
was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came
floating down out of the distance

what is it exclaimed joe under his breath

i wonder said tom in a whisper

taint thunder said huckleberry in an awed tone becuz thunder

hark said tom listen dont talk

they waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn hush

lets go and see

they sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town they
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water the little
steam ferry boat was about a mile below the village drifting with the
current her broad deck seemed crowded with people there were a great
many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
of the ferryboat but the boys could not determine what the men in
them were doing presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
ferryboats side and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud that same
dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again

i know now exclaimed tom somebodys drownded

thats it said huck they done that last summer when bill turner
got drownded they shoot a cannon over the water and that makes
him come up to the top yes and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in em and set em afloat and wherever theres anybody
thats drownded theyll float right there and stop

yes ive heard about that said joe i wonder what makes the bread
do that

oh it aint the bread so much said tom i reckon its mostly what
they say over it before they start it out

but they dont say anything over it said huck ive seen em and
they dont

well thats funny said tom but maybe they say it to themselves of
course they do anybody might know that

the other boys agreed that there was reason in what tom said because
an ignorant lump of bread uninstructed by an incantation could not
be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
gravity

by jings i wish i was over there now said joe

i do too said huck id give heaps to know who it is

the boys still listened and watched presently a revealing thought
flashed through toms mind and he exclaimed

boys i know whos drownded its us

they felt like heroes in an instant here was a gorgeous triumph they
were missed they were mourned hearts were breaking on their account
tears were being shed accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
lost lads were rising up and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
indulged and best of all the departed were the talk of the whole town
and the envy of all the boys as far as this dazzling notoriety was
concerned this was fine it was worth while to be a pirate after all

as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
and the skiffs disappeared the pirates returned to camp they were
jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
they were making they caught fish cooked supper and ate it and then
fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them
and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
gratifying to look upon from their point of view but when the shadows
of night closed them in they gradually ceased to talk and sat gazing
into the fire with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere the
excitement was gone now and tom and joe could not keep back thoughts
of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as
much as they were misgivings came they grew troubled and unhappy a
sigh or two escaped unawares by and by joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout feeler as to how the others might look upon a return to
civilization not right now but

tom withered him with derision huck being uncommitted as yet joined
in with tom and the waverer quickly explained and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken hearted home sickness
clinging to his garments as he could mutiny was effectually laid to
rest for the moment

as the night deepened huck began to nod and presently to snore
joe followed next tom lay upon his elbow motionless for some time
watching the two intently at last he got up cautiously on his knees
and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
by the campfire he picked up and inspected several large semi cylinders
of the thin white bark of a sycamore and finally chose two which seemed
to suit him then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something
upon each of these with his red keel one he rolled up and put in his
jacket pocket and the other he put in joes hat and removed it to a
little distance from the owner and he also put into the hat certain
schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value among them a lump of
chalk an india rubber ball three fishhooks and one of that kind
of marbles known as a sure nough crystal then he tiptoed his way
cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing and
straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar




chapter xv

a few minutes later tom was in the shoal water of the bar wading toward
the illinois shore before the depth reached his middle he was halfway
over the current would permit no more wading now so he struck out
confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards he swam quartering
upstream but still was swept downward rather faster than he had
expected however he reached the shore finally and drifted along till
he found a low place and drew himself out he put his hand on his jacket
pocket found his piece of bark safe and then struck through the woods
following the shore with streaming garments shortly before ten
oclock he came out into an open place opposite the village and saw the
ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank everything
was quiet under the blinking stars he crept down the bank watching
with all his eyes slipped into the water swam three or four strokes
and climbed into the skiff that did yawl duty at the boats stern he
laid himself down under the thwarts and waited panting

presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to cast
off a minute or two later the skiffs head was standing high up
against the boats swell and the voyage was begun tom felt happy in
his success for he knew it was the boats last trip for the night at
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped and
tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk landing fifty yards
downstream out of danger of possible stragglers

he flew along unfrequented alleys and shortly found himself at his
aunts back fence he climbed over approached the ell and looked
in at the sitting room window for a light was burning there there
sat aunt polly sid mary and joe harpers mother grouped together
talking they were by the bed and the bed was between them and the
door tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack he continued pushing
cautiously and quaking every time it creaked till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees so he put his head through and began
warily

what makes the candle blow so said aunt polly tom hurried up why
that doors open i believe why of course it is no end of strange
things now go long and shut it sid

tom disappeared under the bed just in time he lay and breathed
himself for a time and then crept to where he could almost touch his
aunts foot

but as i was saying said aunt polly he warnt bad so to say only
misch ee vous only just giddy and harum scarum you know he warnt
any more responsible than a colt he never meant any harm and he was
the best hearted boy that ever was and she began to cry

it was just so with my joe always full of his devilment and up to
every kind of mischief but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
could be and laws bless me to think i went and whipped him for taking
that cream never once recollecting that i throwed it out myself because
it was sour and i never to see him again in this world never never
never poor abused boy and mrs harper sobbed as if her heart would
break

i hope toms better off where he is said sid but if hed been
better in some ways

sid tom felt the glare of the old ladys eye though he could not
see it not a word against my tom now that hes gone godll take care
of him never you trouble your self sir oh mrs harper i dont
know how to give him up i dont know how to give him up he was such a
comfort to me although he tormented my old heart out of me most

the lord giveth and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of
the lord but its so hard oh its so hard only last saturday my joe
busted a firecracker right under my nose and i knocked him sprawling
little did i know then how soon oh if it was to do over again id hug
him and bless him for it

yes yes yes i know just how you feel mrs harper i know just
exactly how you feel no longer ago than yesterday noon my tom took
and filled the cat full of pain killer and i did think the cretur would
tear the house down and god forgive me i cracked toms head with my
thimble poor boy poor dead boy but hes out of all his troubles now
and the last words i ever heard him say was to reproach

but this memory was too much for the old lady and she broke entirely
down tom was snuffling now himself and more in pity of himself than
anybody else he could hear mary crying and putting in a kindly word
for him from time to time he began to have a nobler opinion of himself
than ever before still he was sufficiently touched by his aunts grief
to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy and
the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his
nature too but he resisted and lay still

he went on listening and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim
then the small raft had been missed next certain boys said the missing
lads had promised that the village should hear something soon the
wise heads had put this and that together and decided that the lads
had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below
presently but toward noon the raft had been found lodged against the
missouri shore some five or six miles below the village and then hope
perished they must be drowned else hunger would have driven them home
by nightfall if not sooner it was believed that the search for the
bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must
have occurred in mid channel since the boys being good swimmers would
otherwise have escaped to shore this was wednesday night if the bodies
continued missing until sunday all hope would be given over and the
funerals would be preached on that morning tom shuddered

mrs harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each others
arms and had a good consoling cry and then parted aunt polly was
tender far beyond her wont in her goodnight to sid and mary sid
snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart

aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly so appealingly
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice
that he was weltering in tears again long before she was through

he had to keep still long after she went to bed for she kept making
broken hearted ejaculations from time to time tossing unrestfully and
turning over but at last she was still only moaning a little in her
sleep now the boy stole out rose gradually by the bedside shaded the
candle light with his hand and stood regarding her his heart was full
of pity for her he took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
candle but something occurred to him and he lingered considering
his face lighted with a happy solution of his thought he put the bark
hastily in his pocket then he bent over and kissed the faded lips and
straightway made his stealthy exit latching the door behind him

he threaded his way back to the ferry landing found nobody at large
there and walked boldly on board the boat for he knew she was
tenantless except that there was a watchman who always turned in and
slept like a graven image he untied the skiff at the stern slipped
into it and was soon rowing cautiously upstream when he had pulled a
mile above the village he started quartering across and bent himself
stoutly to his work he hit the landing on the other side neatly for
this was a familiar bit of work to him he was moved to capture
the skiff arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a pirate but he knew a thorough search would be
made for it and that might end in revelations so he stepped ashore and
entered the woods

he sat down and took a long rest torturing himself meanwhile to keep
awake and then started warily down the home stretch the night was far
spent it was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
island bar he rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
great river with its splendor and then he plunged into the stream a
little later he paused dripping upon the threshold of the camp and
heard joe say

no toms true blue huck and hell come back he wont desert he
knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate and toms too proud for that
sort of thing hes up to something or other now i wonder what

well the things is ours anyway aint they

pretty near but not yet huck the writing says they are if he aint
back here to breakfast

which he is exclaimed tom with fine dramatic effect stepping
grandly into camp

a sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided and as the
boys set to work upon it tom recounted and adorned his adventures
they were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done
then tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon and the
other pirates got ready to fish and explore




chapter xvi

after dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar
they went about poking sticks into the sand and when they found a soft
place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands sometimes
they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole they were perfectly
round white things a trifle smaller than an english walnut they had a
famous fried egg feast that night and another on friday morning

after breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar and
chased each other round and round shedding clothes as they went until
they were naked and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
water of the bar against the stiff current which latter tripped their
legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun
and now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
others faces with their palms gradually approaching each other with
averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays and finally gripping and
struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor and then they all
went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing
sputtering laughing and gasping for breath at one and the same time

when they were well exhausted they would run out and sprawl on the dry
hot sand and lie there and cover themselves up with it and by and by
break for the water again and go through the original performance once
more finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented
flesh colored tights very fairly so they drew a ring in the sand and
had a circus with three clowns in it for none would yield this proudest
post to his neighbor

next they got their marbles and played knucks and ringtaw and
keeps till that amusement grew stale then joe and huck had another
swim but tom would not venture because he found that in kicking off
his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
ankle and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
protection of this mysterious charm he did not venture again until he
had found it and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
rest they gradually wandered apart dropped into the dumps and
fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
drowsing in the sun tom found himself writing becky in the sand with
his big toe he scratched it out and was angry with himself for his
weakness but he wrote it again nevertheless he could not help it he
erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving
the other boys together and joining them

but joes spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection he was so
homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it the tears lay
very near the surface huck was melancholy too tom was downhearted
but tried hard not to show it he had a secret which he was not ready
to tell yet but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon he
would have to bring it out he said with a great show of cheerfulness

i bet theres been pirates on this island before boys well explore
it again theyve hid treasures here somewhere howd you feel to light
on a rotten chest full of gold and silver hey

but it roused only faint enthusiasm which faded out with no reply
tom tried one or two other seductions but they failed too it was
discouraging work joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
very gloomy finally he said

oh boys lets give it up i want to go home its so lonesome

oh no joe youll feel better by and by said tom just think of the
fishing thats here

i dont care for fishing i want to go home

but joe there aint such another swimming place anywhere

swimmings no good i dont seem to care for it somehow when there
aint anybody to say i shant go in i mean to go home

oh shucks baby you want to see your mother i reckon

yes i do want to see my mother and you would too if you had one i
aint any more baby than you are and joe snuffled a little

well well let the crybaby go home to his mother wont we huck poor
thing does it want to see its mother and so it shall you like it here
dont you huck well stay wont we

huck said y e s without any heart in it

ill never speak to you again as long as i live said joe rising
there now and he moved moodily away and began to dress himself

who cares said tom nobody wants you to go long home and get
laughed at oh youre a nice pirate huck and me aint crybabies well
stay wont we huck let him go if he wants to i reckon we can get
along without him peraps

but tom was uneasy nevertheless and was alarmed to see joe go sullenly
on with his dressing and then it was discomforting to see huck eying
joes preparations so wistfully and keeping up such an ominous silence
presently without a parting word joe began to wade off toward the
illinois shore toms heart began to sink he glanced at huck huck
could not bear the look and dropped his eyes then he said

i want to go too tom it was getting so lonesome anyway and now
itll be worse lets us go too tom

i wont you can all go if you want to i mean to stay

tom i better go

well go long whos hendering you

huck began to pick up his scattered clothes he said

tom i wisht youd come too now you think it over well wait for you
when we get to shore

well youll wait a blame long time thats all

huck started sorrowfully away and tom stood looking after him with a
strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along
too he hoped the boys would stop but they still waded slowly on it
suddenly dawned on tom that it was become very lonely and still he made
one final struggle with his pride and then darted after his comrades
yelling

wait wait i want to tell you something

they presently stopped and turned around when he got to where they
were he began unfolding his secret and they listened moodily till
at last they saw the point he was driving at and then they set up a
warwhoop of applause and said it was splendid and said if he had
told them at first they wouldnt have started away he made a plausible
excuse but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
would keep them with him any very great length of time and so he had
meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction

the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will
chattering all the time about toms stupendous plan and admiring the
genius of it after a dainty egg and fish dinner tom said he wanted to
learn to smoke now joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
try too so huck made pipes and filled them these novices had never
smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine and they bit the
tongue and were not considered manly anyway

now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff
charily and with slender confidence the smoke had an unpleasant taste
and they gagged a little but tom said

why its just as easy if id a knowed this was all id a learnt long
ago

so would i said joe its just nothing

why many a time ive looked at people smoking and thought well i wish
i could do that but i never thought i could said tom

thats just the way with me haint it huck youve heard me talk just
that way havent you huck ill leave it to huck if i havent

yes heaps of times said huck

well i have too said tom oh hundreds of times once down by the
slaughter house dont you remember huck bob tanner was there and
johnny miller and jeff thatcher when i said it dont you remember
huck bout me saying that

yes thats so said huck that was the day after i lost a white
alley no twas the day before

there i told you so said tom huck recollects it

i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day said joe i dont feel
sick

neither do i said tom i could smoke it all day but i bet you jeff
thatcher couldnt

jeff thatcher why hed keel over just with two draws just let him
try it once hed see

i bet he would and johnny miller i wish could see johnny miller tackle
it once

oh dont i said joe why i bet you johnny miller couldnt any more
do this than nothing just one little snifter would fetch him

deed it would joe say i wish the boys could see us now

so do i

say boys dont say anything about it and some time when theyre
around ill come up to you and say joe got a pipe i want a smoke
and youll say kind of careless like as if it warnt anything youll
say yes i got my old pipe and another one but my tobacker aint
very good and ill say oh thats all right if its strong
enough and then youll out with the pipes and well light up just as
cam and then just see em look

by jings thatll be gay tom i wish it was now

so do i and when we tell em we learned when we was off pirating
wont they wish theyd been along

oh i reckon not ill just bet they will

so the talk ran on but presently it began to flag a trifle and
grow disjointed the silences widened the expectoration marvellously
increased every pore inside the boys cheeks became a spouting
fountain they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
fast enough to prevent an inundation little overflowings down their
throats occurred in spite of all they could do and sudden retchings
followed every time both boys were looking very pale and miserable
now joes pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers toms followed both
fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and
main joe said feebly

ive lost my knife i reckon i better go and find it

tom said with quivering lips and halting utterance

ill help you you go over that way and ill hunt around by the spring
no you neednt come huck we can find it

so huck sat down again and waited an hour then he found it lonesome
and went to find his comrades they were wide apart in the woods both
very pale both fast asleep but something informed him that if they had
had any trouble they had got rid of it

they were not talkative at supper that night they had a humble look
and when huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
theirs they said no they were not feeling very well something they ate
at dinner had disagreed with them

about midnight joe awoke and called the boys there was a brooding
oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something the boys
huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of
the fire though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was
stifling they sat still intent and waiting the solemn hush continued
beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the
blackness of darkness presently there came a quivering glow that
vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished by and by
another came a little stronger then another then a faint moan came
sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
breath upon their cheeks and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit
of the night had gone by there was a pause now a weird flash turned
night into day and showed every little grassblade separate and
distinct that grew about their feet and it showed three white
startled faces too a deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance a
sweep of chilly air passed by rustling all the leaves and snowing the
flaky ashes broadcast about the fire another fierce glare lit up the
forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops
right over the boys heads they clung together in terror in the thick
gloom that followed a few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves

quick boys go for the tent exclaimed tom

they sprang away stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark no
two plunging in the same direction a furious blast roared through
the trees making everything sing as it went one blinding flash after
another came and peal on peal of deafening thunder and now a drenching
rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the
ground the boys cried out to each other but the roaring wind and the
booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly however one by one
they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent cold scared
and streaming with water but to have company in misery seemed something
to be grateful for they could not talk the old sail flapped so
furiously even if the other noises would have allowed them the tempest
rose higher and higher and presently the sail tore loose from its
fastenings and went winging away on the blast the boys seized each
others hands and fled with many tumblings and bruises to the shelter
of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank now the battle was at its
highest under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed
in the skies everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless
distinctness the bending trees the billowy river white with foam the
driving spray of spumeflakes the dim outlines of the high bluffs on
the other side glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting
veil of rain every little while some giant tree yielded the fight
and fell crashing through the younger growth and the unflagging
thunderpeals came now in ear splitting explosive bursts keen and sharp
and unspeakably appalling the storm culminated in one matchless effort
that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces burn it up drown it to
the treetops blow it away and deafen every creature in it all at one
and the same moment it was a wild night for homeless young heads to be
out in

but at last the battle was done and the forces retired with weaker and
weaker threatenings and grumblings and peace resumed her sway the
boys went back to camp a good deal awed but they found there was still
something to be thankful for because the great sycamore the shelter
of their beds was a ruin now blasted by the lightnings and they were
not under it when the catastrophe happened

everything in camp was drenched the campfire as well for they were but
heedless lads like their generation and had made no provision against
rain here was matter for dismay for they were soaked through and
chilled they were eloquent in their distress but they presently
discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
been built against where it curved upward and separated itself from
the ground that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting so they
patiently wrought until with shreds and bark gathered from the under
sides of sheltered logs they coaxed the fire to burn again then they
piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace and were
gladhearted once more they dried their boiled ham and had a feast
and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their
midnight adventure until morning for there was not a dry spot to sleep
on anywhere around

as the sun began to steal in upon the boys drowsiness came over
them and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep they got
scorched out by and by and drearily set about getting breakfast after
the meal they felt rusty and stiff jointed and a little homesick once
more tom saw the signs and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as
he could but they cared nothing for marbles or circus or swimming or
anything he reminded them of the imposing secret and raised a ray of
cheer while it lasted he got them interested in a new device this was
to knock off being pirates for a while and be indians for a change
they were attracted by this idea so it was not long before they were
stripped and striped from head to heel with black mud like so many
zebras all of them chiefs of course and then they went tearing through
the woods to attack an english settlement

by and by they separated into three hostile tribes and darted upon each
other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops and killed and scalped each
other by thousands it was a gory day consequently it was an extremely
satisfactory one

they assembled in camp toward suppertime hungry and happy but now
a difficulty arose hostile indians could not break the bread of
hospitality together without first making peace and this was a simple
impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace there was no other
process that ever they had heard of two of the savages almost wished
they had remained pirates however there was no other way so with such
show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and
took their whiff as it passed in due form

and behold they were glad they had gone into savagery for they had
gained something they found that they could now smoke a little without
having to go and hunt for a lost knife they did not get sick enough to
be seriously uncomfortable they were not likely to fool away this high
promise for lack of effort no they practised cautiously after supper
with right fair success and so they spent a jubilant evening they were
prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been
in the scalping and skinning of the six nations we will leave them to
smoke and chatter and brag since we have no further use for them at
present




chapter xvii

but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil saturday
afternoon the harpers and aunt pollys family were being put into
mourning with great grief and many tears an unusual quiet possessed
the village although it was ordinarily quiet enough in all conscience
the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air and talked
little but they sighed often the saturday holiday seemed a burden to
the children they had no heart in their sports and gradually gave them
up

in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
schoolhouse yard and feeling very melancholy but she found nothing
there to comfort her she soliloquized

oh if i only had a brass andiron knob again but i havent got
anything now to remember him by and she choked back a little sob

presently she stopped and said to herself

it was right here oh if it was to do over again i wouldnt say
that i wouldnt say it for the whole world but hes gone now ill
never never never see him any more

this thought broke her down and she wandered away with tears rolling
down her cheeks then quite a group of boys and girls playmates of toms
and joes came by and stood looking over the paling fence and talking
in reverent tones of how tom did so and so the last time they saw
him and how joe said this and that small trifle pregnant with awful
prophecy as they could easily see now and each speaker pointed out
the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time and then added
something like and i was a standing just so just as i am now and as if
you was him i was as close as that and he smiled just this way and then
something seemed to go all over me like awful you know and i never
thought what it meant of course but i can see now

then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life and
many claimed that dismal distinction and offered evidences more or
less tampered with by the witness and when it was ultimately decided
who did see the departed last and exchanged the last words with them
the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance
and were gaped at and envied by all the rest one poor chap who had
no other grandeur to offer said with tolerably manifest pride in the
remembrance

well tom sawyer he licked me once

but that bid for glory was a failure most of the boys could say that
and so that cheapened the distinction too much the group loitered away
still recalling memories of the lost heroes in awed voices

when the sunday school hour was finished the next morning the bell
began to toll instead of ringing in the usual way it was a very still
sabbath and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature the villagers began to gather loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event but there
was no whispering in the house only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there none
could remember when the little church had been so full before there
was finally a waiting pause an expectant dumbness and then aunt polly
entered followed by sid and mary and they by the harper family all in
deep black and the whole congregation the old minister as well rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew
there was another communing silence broken at intervals by muffled
sobs and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed a moving
hymn was sung and the text followed i am the resurrection and the
life

as the service proceeded the clergyman drew such pictures of the
graces the winning ways and the rare promise of the lost lads that
every soul there thinking he recognized these pictures felt a pang
in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
before and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
boys the minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
departed too which illustrated their sweet generous natures and the
people could easily see now how noble and beautiful those episodes
were and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
seemed rank rascalities well deserving of the cowhide the congregation
became more and more moved as the pathetic tale went on till at last
the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus
of anguished sobs the preacher himself giving way to his feelings and
crying in the pulpit

there was a rustle in the gallery which nobody noticed a moment later
the church door creaked the minister raised his streaming eyes above
his handkerchief and stood transfixed first one and then another pair
of eyes followed the ministers and then almost with one impulse the
congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
the aisle tom in the lead joe next and huck a ruin of drooping rags
sneaking sheepishly in the rear they had been hid in the unused gallery
listening to their own funeral sermon

aunt polly mary and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored
ones smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings while
poor huck stood abashed and uncomfortable not knowing exactly what
to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes he wavered and
started to slink away but tom seized him and said

aunt polly it aint fair somebodys got to be glad to see huck

and so they shall im glad to see him poor motherless thing and
the loving attentions aunt polly lavished upon him were the one thing
capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before

suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice praise god from
whom all blessings flow sing and put your hearts in it

and they did old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst and
while it shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
proudest moment of his life

as the sold congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that
once more

tom got more cuffs and kisses that day according to aunt pollys varying
moods than he had earned before in a year and he hardly knew which
expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself




chapter xviii

that was toms great secret the scheme to return home with his brother
pirates and attend their own funerals they had paddled over to the
missouri shore on a log at dusk on saturday landing five or six miles
below the village they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town
till nearly daylight and had then crept through back lanes and alleys
and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of
invalided benches

at breakfast monday morning aunt polly and mary were very loving to
tom and very attentive to his wants there was an unusual amount of
talk in the course of it aunt polly said

well i dont say it wasnt a fine joke tom to keep everybody
suffering most a week so you boys had a good time but it is a pity you
could be so hard hearted as to let me suffer so if you could come over
on a log to go to your funeral you could have come over and give me a
hint some way that you warnt dead but only run off

yes you could have done that tom said mary and i believe you
would if you had thought of it

would you tom said aunt polly her face lighting wistfully say
now would you if youd thought of it

i well i dont know twould a spoiled everything

tom i hoped you loved me that much said aunt polly with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy it would have been something if youd
cared enough to think of it even if you didnt do it

now auntie that aint any harm pleaded mary its only toms giddy
way he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything

mores the pity sid would have thought and sid would have come and
done it too tom youll look back some day when its too late
and wish youd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little

now auntie you know i do care for you said tom

id know it better if you acted more like it

i wish now id thought said tom with a repentant tone but i dreamt
about you anyway thats something aint it

it aint much a cat does that much but its better than nothing what
did you dream

why wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed and sid was sitting by the woodbox and mary next to him

well so we did so we always do im glad your dreams could take even
that much trouble about us

and i dreamt that joe harpers mother was here

why she was here did you dream any more

oh lots but its so dim now

well try to recollect cant you

somehow it seems to me that the wind the wind blowed the the

try harder tom the wind did blow something come

tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute and then
said

ive got it now ive got it now it blowed the candle

mercy on us go on tom go on

and it seems to me that you said why i believe that that door

go on tom

just let me study a moment just a moment oh yes you said you believed
the door was open

as im sitting here i did didnt i mary go on

and then and then well i wont be certain but it seems like as if you
made sid go and and

well well what did i make him do tom what did i make him do

you made him you oh you made him shut it

well for the lands sake i never heard the beat of that in all my
days dont tell me there aint anything in dreams any more sereny
harper shall know of this before im an hour older id like to see her
get around this with her rubbage bout superstition go on tom

oh its all getting just as bright as day now next you said i warnt
bad only mischeevous and harum scarum and not any more responsible
than than i think it was a colt or something

and so it was well goodness gracious go on tom

and then you began to cry

so i did so i did not the first time neither and then

then mrs harper she began to cry and said joe was just the same and
she wished she hadnt whipped him for taking cream when shed throwed it
out her own self

tom the sperrit was upon you you was a prophesying thats what you
was doing land alive go on tom

then sid he said he said

i dont think i said anything said sid

yes you did sid said mary

shut your heads and let tom go on what did he say tom

he said i think he said he hoped i was better off where i was gone
to but if id been better sometimes

there dyou hear that it was his very words

and you shut him up sharp

i lay i did there must a been an angel there there was an angel
there somewheres

and mrs harper told about joe scaring her with a firecracker and you
told about peter and the pain killer

just as true as i live

and then there was a whole lot of talk bout dragging the river for us
and bout having the funeral sunday and then you and old miss harper
hugged and cried and she went

it happened just so it happened just so as sure as im a sitting in
these very tracks tom you couldnt told it more like if youd a seen
it and then what go on tom

then i thought you prayed for me and i could see you and hear every
word you said and you went to bed and i was so sorry that i took and
wrote on a piece of sycamore bark we aint dead we are only off being
pirates and put it on the table by the candle and then you looked
so good laying there asleep that i thought i went and leaned over and
kissed you on the lips

did you tom did you i just forgive you everything for that and
she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
guiltiest of villains

it was very kind even though it was only a dream sid soliloquized
just audibly

shut up sid a body does just the same in a dream as hed do if he was
awake heres a big milum apple ive been saving for you tom if you
was ever found again now go long to school im thankful to the good
god and father of us all ive got you back thats long suffering and
merciful to them that believe on him and keep his word though goodness
knows im unworthy of it but if only the worthy ones got his blessings
and had his hand to help them over the rough places theres few enough
would smile here or ever enter into his rest when the long night comes
go long sid mary tom take yourselves off youve hendered me long
enough

the children left for school and the old lady to call on mrs harper
and vanquish her realism with toms marvellous dream sid had better
judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
house it was this pretty thin as long a dream as that without any
mistakes in it

what a hero tom was become now he did not go skipping and prancing
but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
public eye was on him and indeed it was he tried not to seem to see
the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along but they were food and
drink to him smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels as proud
to be seen with him and tolerated by him as if he had been the drummer
at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into
town boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at
all but they were consuming with envy nevertheless they would have
given anything to have that swarthy sun tanned skin of his and his
glittering notoriety and tom would not have parted with either for a
circus

at school the children made so much of him and of joe and delivered
such eloquent admiration from their eyes that the two heroes were
not long in becoming insufferably stuck up they began to tell their
adventures to hungry listeners but they only began it was not a
thing likely to have an end with imaginations like theirs to furnish
material and finally when they got out their pipes and went serenely
puffing around the very summit of glory was reached

tom decided that he could be independent of becky thatcher now glory
was sufficient he would live for glory now that he was distinguished
maybe she would be wanting to make up well let her she should see
that he could be as indifferent as some other people presently she
arrived tom pretended not to see her he moved away and joined a group
of boys and girls and began to talk soon he observed that she was
tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes
pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates and screaming with laughter
when she made a capture but he noticed that she always made her
captures in his vicinity and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such times too it gratified all the vicious vanity
that was in him and so instead of winning him it only set him up
the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he
knew she was about presently she gave over skylarking and moved
irresolutely about sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward tom then she observed that now tom was talking more
particularly to amy lawrence than to any one else she felt a sharp pang
and grew disturbed and uneasy at once she tried to go away but her
feet were treacherous and carried her to the group instead she said to
a girl almost at toms elbow with sham vivacity

why mary austin you bad girl why didnt you come to sunday school

i did come didnt you see me

why no did you where did you sit

i was in miss peters class where i always go i saw you

did you why its funny i didnt see you i wanted to tell you about
the picnic

oh thats jolly whos going to give it

my mas going to let me have one

oh goody i hope shell let me come

well she will the picnics for me shell let anybody come that i
want and i want you

thats ever so nice when is it going to be

by and by maybe about vacation

oh wont it be fun you going to have all the girls and boys

yes every one thats friends to me or wants to be and she glanced
ever so furtively at tom but he talked right along to amy lawrence
about the terrible storm on the island and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree all to flinders while he was standing within
three feet of it

oh may i come said grace miller

yes

and me said sally rogers

yes

and me too said susy harper and joe

yes

and so on with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but tom and amy then tom turned coolly away still
talking and took amy with him beckys lips trembled and the tears
came to her eyes she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
chattering but the life had gone out of the picnic now and out of
everything else she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
had what her sex call a good cry then she sat moody with wounded
pride till the bell rang she roused up now with a vindictive cast
in her eye and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
shed do

at recess tom continued his flirtation with amy with jubilant
self satisfaction and he kept drifting about to find becky and lacerate
her with the performance at last he spied her but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture book with alfred temple and so
absorbed were they and their heads so close together over the book
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides
jealousy ran red hot through toms veins he began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance becky had offered for a reconciliation he
called himself a fool and all the hard names he could think of he
wanted to cry with vexation amy chatted happily along as they walked
for her heart was singing but toms tongue had lost its function he
did not hear what amy was saying and whenever she paused expectantly
he could only stammer an awkward assent which was as often misplaced
as otherwise he kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse again and
again to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there he could
not help it and it maddened him to see as he thought he saw that
becky thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
living but she did see nevertheless and she knew she was winning her
fight too and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered

amys happy prattle became intolerable tom hinted at things he had
to attend to things that must be done and time was fleeting but in
vain the girl chirped on tom thought oh hang her aint i ever going
to get rid of her at last he must be attending to those things and she
said artlessly that she would be around when school let out and he
hastened away hating her for it

any other boy tom thought grating his teeth any boy in the whole
town but that saint louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
aristocracy oh all right i licked you the first day you ever saw this
town mister and ill lick you again you just wait till i catch you
out ill just take and

and he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy pummelling
the air and kicking and gouging oh you do do you you holler
nough do you now then let that learn you and so the imaginary
flogging was finished to his satisfaction

tom fled home at noon his conscience could not endure any more of amys
grateful happiness and his jealousy could bear no more of the other
distress becky resumed her picture inspections with alfred but as the
minutes dragged along and no tom came to suffer her triumph began to
cloud and she lost interest gravity and absentmindedness followed
and then melancholy two or three times she pricked up her ear at
a footstep but it was a false hope no tom came at last she grew
entirely miserable and wished she hadnt carried it so far when
poor alfred seeing that he was losing her he did not know how kept
exclaiming oh heres a jolly one look at this she lost patience at
last and said oh dont bother me i dont care for them and burst
into tears and got up and walked away

alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her but she
said

go away and leave me alone cant you i hate you

so the boy halted wondering what he could have done for she had said
she would look at pictures all through the nooning and she walked on
crying then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse he was
humiliated and angry he easily guessed his way to the truth the girl
had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom sawyer
he was far from hating tom the less when this thought occurred to him
he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
risk to himself toms spelling book fell under his eye here was his
opportunity he gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
poured ink upon the page

becky glancing in at a window behind him at the moment saw the act
and moved on without discovering herself she started homeward now
intending to find tom and tell him tom would be thankful and their
troubles would be healed before she was half way home however she
had changed her mind the thought of toms treatment of her when she was
talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame
she resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling books
account and to hate him forever into the bargain




chapter xix

tom arrived at home in a dreary mood and the first thing his aunt said
to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising
market

tom ive a notion to skin you alive

auntie what have i done

well youve done enough here i go over to sereny harper like an old
softy expecting im going to make her believe all that rubbage about
that dream when lo and behold you shed found out from joe that you was
over here and heard all the talk we had that night tom i dont know
what is to become of a boy that will act like that it makes me feel so
bad to think you could let me go to sereny harper and make such a fool
of myself and never say a word

this was a new aspect of the thing his smartness of the morning had
seemed to tom a good joke before and very ingenious it merely looked
mean and shabby now he hung his head and could not think of anything to
say for a moment then he said

auntie i wish i hadnt done it but i didnt think

oh child you never think you never think of anything but your
own selfishness you could think to come all the way over here from
jacksons island in the night to laugh at our troubles and you could
think to fool me with a lie about a dream but you couldnt ever think
to pity us and save us from sorrow

auntie i know now it was mean but i didnt mean to be mean i didnt
honest and besides i didnt come over here to laugh at you that
night

what did you come for then

it was to tell you not to be uneasy about us because we hadnt got
drownded

tom tom i would be the thankfullest soul in this world if i could
believe you ever had as good a thought as that but you know you never
did and i know it tom

indeed and deed i did auntie i wish i may never stir if i didnt

oh tom dont lie dont do it it only makes things a hundred times
worse

it aint a lie auntie its the truth i wanted to keep you from
grieving that was all that made me come

id give the whole world to believe that it would cover up a power
of sins tom id most be glad youd run off and acted so bad but it
aint reasonable because why didnt you tell me child

why you see when you got to talking about the funeral i just got all
full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church and i couldnt
somehow bear to spoil it so i just put the bark back in my pocket and
kept mum

what bark

the bark i had wrote on to tell you wed gone pirating i wish now
youd waked up when i kissed you i do honest

the hard lines in his aunts face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned
in her eyes

did you kiss me tom

why yes i did

are you sure you did tom

why yes i did auntie certain sure

what did you kiss me for tom

because i loved you so and you laid there moaning and i was so sorry

the words sounded like truth the old lady could not hide a tremor in
her voice when she said

kiss me again tom and be off with you to school now and dont
bother me any more

the moment he was gone she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
jacket which tom had gone pirating in then she stopped with it in her
hand and said to herself

no i dont dare poor boy i reckon hes lied about it but its a
blessed blessed lie theres such a comfort come from it i hope
the lord i know the lord will forgive him because it was such
good heartedness in him to tell it but i dont want to find out its a
lie i wont look

she put the jacket away and stood by musing a minute twice she put out
her hand to take the garment again and twice she refrained once more
she ventured and this time she fortified herself with the thought
its a good lie its a good lie i wont let it grieve me so she
sought the jacket pocket a moment later she was reading toms piece of
bark through flowing tears and saying i could forgive the boy now if
hed committed a million sins




chapter xx

there was something about aunt pollys manner when she kissed tom that
swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again he
started to school and had the luck of coming upon becky thatcher at the
head of meadow lane his mood always determined his manner without a
moments hesitation he ran to her and said

i acted mighty mean today becky and im so sorry i wont ever ever
do that way again as long as ever i live please make up wont you

the girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face

ill thank you to keep yourself to yourself mr thomas sawyer ill
never speak to you again

she tossed her head and passed on tom was so stunned that he had not
even presence of mind enough to say who cares miss smarty until the
right time to say it had gone by so he said nothing but he was in a
fine rage nevertheless he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
a boy and imagining how he would trounce her if she were he presently
encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed she hurled
one in return and the angry breach was complete it seemed to becky in
her hot resentment that she could hardly wait for school to take in
she was so impatient to see tom flogged for the injured spelling book
if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred temple toms
offensive fling had driven it entirely away

poor girl she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself
the master mr dobbins had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
ambition the darling of his desires was to be a doctor but
poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
schoolmaster every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting he kept
that book under lock and key there was not an urchin in school but was
perishing to have a glimpse of it but the chance never came every boy
and girl had a theory about the nature of that book but no two theories
were alike and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case
now as becky was passing by the desk which stood near the door she
noticed that the key was in the lock it was a precious moment she
glanced around found herself alone and the next instant she had the
book in her hands the titlepage professor somebodys anatomy carried
no information to her mind so she began to turn the leaves she came at
once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece a human figure
stark naked at that moment a shadow fell on the page and tom sawyer
stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture becky
snatched at the book to close it and had the hard luck to tear the
pictured page half down the middle she thrust the volume into the desk
turned the key and burst out crying with shame and vexation

tom sawyer you are just as mean as you can be to sneak up on a person
and look at what theyre looking at

how could i know you was looking at anything

you ought to be ashamed of yourself tom sawyer you know youre
going to tell on me and oh what shall i do what shall i do ill be
whipped and i never was whipped in school

then she stamped her little foot and said

be so mean if you want to i know something thats going to happen
you just wait and youll see hateful hateful hateful and she flung
out of the house with a new explosion of crying

tom stood still rather flustered by this onslaught presently he said
to himself

what a curious kind of a fool a girl is never been licked in
school shucks whats a licking thats just like a girl theyre so
thin skinned and chicken hearted well of course i aint going to tell
old dobbins on this little fool because theres other ways of getting
even on her that aint so mean but what of it old dobbins will ask
who it was tore his book nobodyll answer then hell do just the way
he always does ask first one and then tother and when he comes to the
right girl hell know it without any telling girls faces always tell
on them they aint got any backbone shell get licked well its a
kind of a tight place for becky thatcher because there aint any way
out of it tom conned the thing a moment longer and then added all
right though shed like to see me in just such a fix let her sweat it
out

tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside in a few moments the
master arrived and school took in tom did not feel a strong interest
in his studies every time he stole a glance at the girls side of the
room beckys face troubled him considering all things he did not want
to pity her and yet it was all he could do to help it he could get
up no exultation that was really worthy the name presently the
spelling book discovery was made and toms mind was entirely full
of his own matters for a while after that becky roused up from her
lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings she
did not expect that tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
spilt the ink on the book himself and she was right the denial only
seemed to make the thing worse for tom becky supposed she would be glad
of that and she tried to believe she was glad of it but she found she
was not certain when the worst came to the worst she had an impulse
to get up and tell on alfred temple but she made an effort and forced
herself to keep still because said she to herself hell tell about me
tearing the picture sure i wouldnt say a word not to save his life

tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken hearted for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
upset the ink on the spelling book himself in some skylarking bout he
had denied it for forms sake and because it was custom and had stuck
to the denial from principle

a whole hour drifted by the master sat nodding in his throne the air
was drowsy with the hum of study by and by mr dobbins straightened
himself up yawned then unlocked his desk and reached for his book
but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it most of the
pupils glanced up languidly but there were two among them that watched
his movements with intent eyes mr dobbins fingered his book absently
for a while then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read
tom shot a glance at becky he had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
look as she did with a gun levelled at its head instantly he forgot
his quarrel with her quick something must be done done in a flash
too but the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention
good he had an inspiration he would run and snatch the book spring
through the door and fly but his resolution shook for one little
instant and the chance was lost the master opened the volume if tom
only had the wasted opportunity back again too late there was no help
for becky now he said the next moment the master faced the school
every eye sank under his gaze there was that in it which smote even
the innocent with fear there was silence while one might count ten the
master was gathering his wrath then he spoke who tore this book

there was not a sound one could have heard a pin drop the stillness
continued the master searched face after face for signs of guilt

benjamin rogers did you tear this book

a denial another pause

joseph harper did you

another denial toms uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
slow torture of these proceedings the master scanned the ranks of
boys considered a while then turned to the girls

amy lawrence

a shake of the head

gracie miller

the same sign

susan harper did you do this

another negative the next girl was becky thatcher tom was trembling
from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
situation

rebecca thatcher tom glanced at her face it was white with
terror did you tear no look me in the face her hands rose in
appeal did you tear this book

a thought shot like lightning through toms brain he sprang to his feet
and shouted i done it

the school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly tom stood a
moment to gather his dismembered faculties and when he stepped forward
to go to his punishment the surprise the gratitude the adoration that
shone upon him out of poor beckys eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred
floggings inspired by the splendor of his own act he took without
an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr dobbins had ever
administered and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed for he
knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done and not
count the tedious time as loss either

tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple for
with shame and repentance becky had told him all not forgetting her own
treachery but even the longing for vengeance had to give way soon to
pleasanter musings and he fell asleep at last with beckys latest words
lingering dreamily in his ear

tom how could you be so noble




chapter xxi

vacation was approaching the schoolmaster always severe grew severer
and more exacting than ever for he wanted the school to make a good
showing on examination day his rod and his ferule were seldom idle
now at least among the smaller pupils only the biggest boys and young
ladies of eighteen and twenty escaped lashing mr dobbins lashings
were very vigorous ones too for although he carried under his wig a
perfectly bald and shiny head he had only reached middle age and there
was no sign of feebleness in his muscle as the great day approached
all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface he seemed to take a
vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings the consequence
was that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and
their nights in plotting revenge they threw away no opportunity to do
the master a mischief but he kept ahead all the time the retribution
that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that
the boys always retired from the field badly worsted at last they
conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory
they swore in the signpainters boy told him the scheme and asked his
help he had his own reasons for being delighted for the master boarded
in his fathers family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him
the masters wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days and
there would be nothing to interfere with the plan the master always
prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled and
the signpainters boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper
condition on examination evening he would manage the thing while he
napped in his chair then he would have him awakened at the right time
and hurried away to school

in the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived at eight in
the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted and adorned with
wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers the master sat throned in
his great chair upon a raised platform with his blackboard behind him
he was looking tolerably mellow three rows of benches on each side and
six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
and by the parents of the pupils to his left back of the rows of
citizens was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening rows of
small boys washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort
rows of gawky big boys snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms their
grandmothers ancient trinkets their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
the flowers in their hair all the rest of the house was filled with
non participating scholars

the exercises began a very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited
youd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage
etc accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic
gestures which a machine might have used supposing the machine to be a
trifle out of order but he got through safely though cruelly scared
and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
retired

a little shamefaced girl lisped mary had a little lamb etc
performed a compassion inspiring curtsy got her meed of applause and
sat down flushed and happy

tom sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
the unquenchable and indestructible give me liberty or give me death
speech with fine fury and frantic gesticulation and broke down in the
middle of it a ghastly stage fright seized him his legs quaked under
him and he was like to choke true he had the manifest sympathy of the
house but he had the houses silence too which was even worse than
its sympathy the master frowned and this completed the disaster tom
struggled awhile and then retired utterly defeated there was a weak
attempt at applause but it died early

the boy stood on the burning deck followed also the assyrian came
down and other declamatory gems then there were reading exercises
and a spelling fight the meagre latin class recited with honor the
prime feature of the evening was in order now original compositions
by the young ladies each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the
platform cleared her throat held up her manuscript tied with dainty
ribbon and proceeded to read with labored attention to expression
and punctuation the themes were the same that had been illuminated upon
similar occasions by their mothers before them their grandmothers
and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the
crusades friendship was one memories of other days religion in
history dream land the advantages of culture forms of political
government compared and contrasted melancholy filial love heart
longings etc etc

a prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
melancholy another was a wasteful and opulent gush of fine language
another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words
and phrases until they were worn entirely out and a peculiarity that
conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable
sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one
of them no matter what the subject might be a brainracking effort was
made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious
mind could contemplate with edification the glaring insincerity of
these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the
fashion from the schools and it is not sufficient today it never will
be sufficient while the world stands perhaps there is no school in
all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their
compositions with a sermon and you will find that the sermon of the
most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always
the longest and the most relentlessly pious but enough of this homely
truth is unpalatable

let us return to the examination the first composition that was read
was one entitled is this then life perhaps the reader can endure an
extract from it

in the common walks of life with what delightful emotions does the
youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity
imagination is busy sketching rose tinted pictures of joy in fancy the
voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng the
observed of all observers her graceful form arrayed in snowy robes
is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance her eye is brightest
her step is lightest in the gay assembly

in such delicious fancies time quickly glides by and the welcome hour
arrives for her entrance into the elysian world of which she has
had such bright dreams how fairy like does everything appear to her
enchanted vision each new scene is more charming than the last but
after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior all is
vanity the flattery which once charmed her soul now grates harshly
upon her ear the ballroom has lost its charms and with wasted health
and imbittered heart she turns away with the conviction that earthly
pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul

and so forth and so on there was a buzz of gratification from time to
time during the reading accompanied by whispered ejaculations of how
sweet how eloquent so true etc and after the thing had closed
with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic

then arose a slim melancholy girl whose face had the interesting
paleness that comes of pills and indigestion and read a poem two
stanzas of it will do

a missouri maidens farewell to alabama

alabama goodbye i love thee well but yet for a while do i leave thee
now sad yes sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell and burning
recollections throng my brow for i have wandered through thy flowery
woods have roamed and read near tallapoosas stream have listened to
tallassees warring floods and wooed on coosas side auroras beam

yet shame i not to bear an oerfull heart nor blush to turn behind
my tearful eyes tis from no stranger land i now must part tis to no
strangers left i yield these sighs welcome and home were mine within
this state whose vales i leave whose spires fade fast from me and cold
must be mine eyes and heart and tete when dear alabama they turn
cold on thee there were very few there who knew what tete meant but
the poem was very satisfactory nevertheless

next appeared a dark complexioned black eyed black haired young lady
who paused an impressive moment assumed a tragic expression and began
to read in a measured solemn tone

a vision

dark and tempestuous was night around the throne on high not a single
star quivered but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly
vibrated upon the ear whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry
mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven seeming to scorn the power
exerted over its terror by the illustrious franklin even the boisterous
winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes and blustered
about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene

at such a time so dark so dreary for human sympathy my very spirit
sighed but instead thereof

my dearest friend my counsellor my comforter and guide my joy in
grief my second bliss in joy came to my side she moved like one of
those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancys eden by
the romantic and young a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
transcendent loveliness so soft was her step it failed to make even a
sound and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch
as other unobtrusive beauties she would have glided away
unperceived unsought a strange sadness rested upon her features like
icy tears upon the robe of december as she pointed to the contending
elements without and bade me contemplate the two beings presented

this nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
sermon so destructive of all hope to non presbyterians that it took
the first prize this composition was considered to be the very finest
effort of the evening the mayor of the village in delivering the prize
to the author of it made a warm speech in which he said that it was by
far the most eloquent thing he had ever listened to and that daniel
webster himself might well be proud of it

it may be remarked in passing that the number of compositions in which
the word beauteous was over fondled and human experience referred to
as lifes page was up to the usual average

now the master mellow almost to the verge of geniality put his chair
aside turned his back to the audience and began to draw a map of
america on the blackboard to exercise the geography class upon but he
made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand and a smothered titter
rippled over the house he knew what the matter was and set himself to
right it he sponged out lines and remade them but he only distorted
them more than ever and the tittering was more pronounced he threw his
entire attention upon his work now as if determined not to be put down
by the mirth he felt that all eyes were fastened upon him he imagined
he was succeeding and yet the tittering continued it even manifestly
increased and well it might there was a garret above pierced with
a scuttle over his head and down through this scuttle came a cat
suspended around the haunches by a string she had a rag tied about
her head and jaws to keep her from mewing as she slowly descended she
curved upward and clawed at the string she swung downward and clawed
at the intangible air the tittering rose higher and higher the cat was
within six inches of the absorbed teachers head down down a little
lower and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws clung to it
and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still
in her possession and how the light did blaze abroad from the masters
bald pate for the signpainters boy had gilded it

that broke up the meeting the boys were avenged vacation had come

note the pretended compositions quoted in this chapter are taken
without alteration from a volume entitled prose and poetry by a
western lady but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl
pattern and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be




chapter xxii

tom joined the new order of cadets of temperance being attracted by the
showy character of their regalia he promised to abstain from smoking
chewing and profanity as long as he remained a member now he found out
a new thing namely that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way
in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing tom soon
found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear the desire
grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display
himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order fourth
of july was coming but he soon gave that up gave it up before he had
worn his shackles over forty eight hours and fixed his hopes upon old
judge frazer justice of the peace who was apparently on his deathbed
and would have a big public funeral since he was so high an official
during three days tom was deeply concerned about the judges condition
and hungry for news of it sometimes his hopes ran high so high that
he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the
looking glass but the judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating
at last he was pronounced upon the mend and then convalescent tom was
disgusted and felt a sense of injury too he handed in his resignation
at once and that night the judge suffered a relapse and died tom
resolved that he would never trust a man like that again

the funeral was a fine thing the cadets paraded in a style calculated
to kill the late member with envy tom was a free boy again
however there was something in that he could drink and swear now but
found to his surprise that he did not want to the simple fact that he
could took the desire away and the charm of it

tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
to hang a little heavily on his hands

he attempted a diary but nothing happened during three days and so he
abandoned it

the first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town and made a
sensation tom and joe harper got up a band of performers and were happy
for two days

even the glorious fourth was in some sense a failure for it rained
hard there was no procession in consequence and the greatest man
in the world as tom supposed mr benton an actual united states
senator proved an overwhelming disappointment for he was not
twenty five feet high nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it

a circus came the boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
made of rag carpeting admission three pins for boys two for girls and
then circusing was abandoned

a phrenologist and a mesmerizer came and went again and left the village
duller and drearier than ever

there were some boys and girls parties but they were so few and so
delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder

becky thatcher was gone to her constantinople home to stay with her
parents during vacation so there was no bright side to life anywhere

the dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery it was a very
cancer for permanency and pain

then came the measles

during two long weeks tom lay a prisoner dead to the world and its
happenings he was very ill he was interested in nothing when he got
upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown a melancholy change had
come over everything and every creature there had been a revival and
everybody had got religion not only the adults but even the boys and
girls tom went about hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
sinful face but disappointment crossed him everywhere he found joe
harper studying a testament and turned sadly away from the depressing
spectacle he sought ben rogers and found him visiting the poor with a
basket of tracts he hunted up jim hollis who called his attention to
the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning every boy
he encountered added another ton to his depression and when in
desperation he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of huckleberry finn
and was received with a scriptural quotation his heart broke and he
crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost
forever and forever

and that night there came on a terrific storm with driving rain awful
claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning he covered his head
with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom for
he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him
he believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the
extremity of endurance and that this was the result it might have
seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
battery of artillery but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from
under an insect like himself

by and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
object the boys first impulse was to be grateful and reform his
second was to wait for there might not be any more storms

the next day the doctors were back tom had relapsed the three weeks he
spent on his back this time seemed an entire age when he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared remembering how
lonely was his estate how companionless and forlorn he was he drifted
listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder in the presence of her
victim a bird he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon poor lads they like tom had suffered a relapse




chapter xxiii

at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred and vigorously the murder
trial came on in the court it became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately tom could not get away from it every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his heart for his troubled conscience
and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in
his hearing as feelers he did not see how he could be suspected of
knowing anything about the murder but still he could not be comfortable
in the midst of this gossip it kept him in a cold shiver all the time
he took huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him it would be some
relief to unseal his tongue for a little while to divide his burden of
distress with another sufferer moreover he wanted to assure himself
that huck had remained discreet

huck have you ever told anybody about that

bout what

you know what

oh course i havent

never a word

never a solitary word so help me what makes you ask

well i was afeard

why tom sawyer we wouldnt be alive two days if that got found out
you know that

tom felt more comfortable after a pause

huck they couldnt anybody get you to tell could they

get me to tell why if i wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they
could get me to tell they aint no different way

well thats all right then i reckon were safe as long as we keep
mum but lets swear again anyway its more surer

im agreed

so they swore again with dread solemnities

what is the talk around huck ive heard a power of it

talk well its just muff potter muff potter muff potter all the
time it keeps me in a sweat constant sos i want to hide somers

thats just the same way they go on round me i reckon hes a goner
dont you feel sorry for him sometimes

most always most always he aint no account but then he haint ever
done anything to hurt anybody just fishes a little to get money to
get drunk on and loafs around considerable but lord we all do
that leastways most of us preachers and such like but hes kind of
good he give me half a fish once when there warnt enough for two and
lots of times hes kind of stood by me when i was out of luck

well hes mended kites for me huck and knitted hooks on to my line
i wish we could get him out of there

my we couldnt get him out tom and besides twouldnt do any good
theyd ketch him again

yes so they would but i hate to hear em abuse him so like the dickens
when he never done that

i do too tom lord i hear em say hes the bloodiest looking villain
in this country and they wonder he wasnt ever hung before

yes they talk like that all the time ive heard em say that if he
was to get free theyd lynch him

and theyd do it too

the boys had a long talk but it brought them little comfort as the
twilight drew on they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
of the little isolated jail perhaps with an undefined hope that
something would happen that might clear away their difficulties but
nothing happened there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
this luckless captive

the boys did as they had often done before went to the cell grating and
gave potter some tobacco and matches he was on the ground floor and
there were no guards

his gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
before it cut deeper than ever this time they felt cowardly and
treacherous to the last degree when potter said

youve been mighty good to me boys bettern anybody else in this town
and i dont forget it i dont often i says to myself says i i used
to mend all the boys kites and things and show em where the good
fishin places was and befriend em what i could and now theyve
all forgot old muff when hes in trouble but tom dont and huck
dont they dont forget him says i and i dont forget them well
boys i done an awful thing drunk and crazy at the time thats the only
way i account for it and now i got to swing for it and its right
right and best too i reckon hope so anyway well we wont talk
about that i dont want to make you feel bad youve befriended me
but what i want to say is dont you ever get drunk then you wont
ever get here stand a litter furder west so thats it its a prime
comfort to see faces thats friendly when a bodys in such a muck
of trouble and there dont none come here but yourn good friendly
faces good friendly faces git up on one anothers backs and let me
touch em thats it shake hands yournll come through the bars but
mines too big little hands and weak but theyve helped muff potter a
power and theyd help him more if they could

tom went home miserable and his dreams that night were full of horrors
the next day and the day after he hung about the courtroom drawn by an
almost irresistible impulse to go in but forcing himself to stay out
huck was having the same experience they studiously avoided each other
each wandered away from time to time but the same dismal fascination
always brought them back presently tom kept his ears open when idlers
sauntered out of the courtroom but invariably heard distressing
news the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor
potter at the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect
that injun joes evidence stood firm and unshaken and that there was
not the slightest question as to what the jurys verdict would be

tom was out late that night and came to bed through the window he
was in a tremendous state of excitement it was hours before he got to
sleep all the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning for
this was to be the great day both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience after a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places shortly afterward potter pale and haggard timid and
hopeless was brought in with chains upon him and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him no less conspicuous was injun joe
stolid as ever there was another pause and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court the usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed these
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating

now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter washing
in the brook at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
discovered and that he immediately sneaked away after some further
questioning counsel for the prosecution said

take the witness

the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment but dropped them again when
his own counsel said

i have no questions to ask him

the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse
counsel for the prosecution said

take the witness

i have no questions to ask him potters lawyer replied

a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in potters
possession

take the witness

counsel for potter declined to question him the faces of the audience
began to betray annoyance did this attorney mean to throw away his
clients life without an effort

several witnesses deposed concerning potters guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder they were allowed to leave the stand
without being cross questioned

every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
brought out by credible witnesses but none of them were cross examined
by potters lawyer the perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench
counsel for the prosecution now said

by the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion we have
fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of question upon the
unhappy prisoner at the bar we rest our case here

a groan escaped from poor potter and he put his face in his hands and
rocked his body softly to and fro while a painful silence reigned
in the courtroom many men were moved and many womens compassion
testified itself in tears counsel for the defence rose and said

your honor in our remarks at the opening of this trial we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced
by drink we have changed our mind we shall not offer that plea then
to the clerk call thomas sawyer

a puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house not even excepting
potters every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon tom as
he rose and took his place upon the stand the boy looked wild enough
for he was badly scared the oath was administered

thomas sawyer where were you on the seventeenth of june about the
hour of midnight

tom glanced at injun joes iron face and his tongue failed him the
audience listened breathless but the words refused to come after a few
moments however the boy got a little of his strength back and managed
to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear

in the graveyard

a little bit louder please dont be afraid you were

in the graveyard

a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joes face

were you anywhere near horse williams grave

yes sir

speak up just a trifle louder how near were you

near as i am to you

were you hidden or not

i was hid

where

behind the elms thats on the edge of the grave

injun joe gave a barely perceptible start

any one with you

yes sir i went there with

wait wait a moment never mind mentioning your companions name we
will produce him at the proper time did you carry anything there with
you

tom hesitated and looked confused

speak out my boy dont be diffident the truth is always respectable
what did you take there

only a a dead cat

there was a ripple of mirth which the court checked

we will produce the skeleton of that cat now my boy tell us
everything that occurred tell it in your own way dont skip anything
and dont be afraid

tom began hesitatingly at first but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him with parted lips and
bated breath the audience hung upon his words taking no note of time
rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale the strain upon pent
emotion reached its climax when the boy said

and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff potter fell injun
joe jumped with the knife and

crash quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window tore his
way through all opposers and was gone




chapter xxiv

tom was a glittering hero once more the pet of the old the envy of the
young his name even went into immortal print for the village paper
magnified him there were some that believed he would be president yet
if he escaped hanging

as usual the fickle unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before but that sort
of conduct is to the worlds credit therefore it is not well to find
fault with it

toms days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nights
were seasons of horror injun joe infested all his dreams and always
with doom in his eye hardly any temptation could persuade the boy
to stir abroad after nightfall poor huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror for tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial and huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstanding
injun joes flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court
the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what of
that since toms harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyers house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths hucks
confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated

daily muff potters gratitude made tom glad he had spoken but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue

half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured the
other half he was afraid he would be he felt sure he never could draw a
safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse

rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no injun
joe was found one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels a
detective came up from st louis moused around shook his head looked
wise and made that sort of astounding success which members of that
craft usually achieve that is to say he found a clew but you cant
hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had got through
and gone home tom felt just as insecure as he was before

the slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension




chapter xxv

there comes a time in every rightly constructed boys life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure this desire
suddenly came upon tom one day he sallied out to find joe harper
but failed of success next he sought ben rogers he had gone fishing
presently he stumbled upon huck finn the red handed huck would
answer tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him
confidentially huck was willing huck was always willing to take a hand
in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital
for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
not money wherell we dig said huck

oh most anywhere

why is it hid all around

no indeed it aint its hid in mighty particular places
huck sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of
a limb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight but
mostly under the floor in hanted houses

who hides it

why robbers of course whod you reckon sunday school
suprintendents

i dont know if twas mine i wouldnt hide it id spend it and have a
good time

so would i but robbers dont do that way they always hide it and
leave it there

dont they come after it any more

no they think they will but they generally forget the marks or else
they die anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty and by and
by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks a
paper thats got to be ciphered over about a week because its mostly
signs and hyroglyphics

hyro which

hyroglyphics pictures and things you know that dont seem to mean
anything

have you got one of them papers tom

no

well then how you going to find the marks

i dont want any marks they always bury it under a hanted house or on
an island or under a dead tree thats got one limb sticking out well
weve tried jacksons island a little and we can try it again some
time and theres the old hanted house up the still house branch and
theres lots of dead limb trees dead loads of em

is it under all of them

how you talk no

then how you going to know which one to go for

go for all of em

why tom itll take all summer

well what of that suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars
in it all rusty and gray or rotten chest full of dimonds hows
that

hucks eyes glowed

thats bully plenty bully enough for me just you gimme the hundred
dollars and i dont want no dimonds

all right but i bet you i aint going to throw off on dimonds some
of ems worth twenty dollars apiece there aint any hardly buts
worth six bits or a dollar

no is that so

certnly anybodyll tell you so haint you ever seen one huck

not as i remember

oh kings have slathers of them

well i don know no kings tom

i reckon you dont but if you was to go to europe youd see a raft of
em hopping around

do they hop

hop your granny no

well what did you say they did for

shucks i only meant youd see em not hopping of course what do
they want to hop for but i mean youd just see em scattered around
you know in a kind of a general way like that old humpbacked richard

richard whats his other name

he didnt have any other name kings dont have any but a given name

no

but they dont

well if they like it tom all right but i dont want to be a king
and have only just a given name like a nigger but say where you going
to dig first

well i dont know spose we tackle that old dead limb tree on the
hill tother side of still house branch

im agreed

so they got a crippled pick and a shovel and set out on their
three mile tramp they arrived hot and panting and threw themselves
down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke

i like this said tom

so do i

say huck if we find a treasure here what you going to do with your
share

well ill have pie and a glass of soda every day and ill go to every
circus that comes along i bet ill have a gay time

well aint you going to save any of it

save it what for

why so as to have something to live on by and by

oh that aint any use pap would come back to thish yer town some day
and get his claws on it if i didnt hurry up and i tell you hed clean
it out pretty quick what you going to do with yourn tom

im going to buy a new drum and a surenough sword and a red necktie
and a bull pup and get married

married

thats it

tom you why you aint in your right mind

wait youll see

well thats the foolishest thing you could do look at pap and my
mother fight why they used to fight all the time i remember mighty
well

that aint anything the girl im going to marry wont fight

tom i reckon theyre all alike theyll all comb a body now you
better think bout this awhile i tell you you better whats the name
of the gal

it aint a gal at all its a girl

its all the same i reckon some says gal some says girl boths
right like enough anyway whats her name tom

ill tell you some time not now

all right thatll do only if you get married ill be more lonesomer
than ever

no you wont youll come and live with me now stir out of this and
well go to digging

they worked and sweated for half an hour no result they toiled another
halfhour still no result huck said

do they always bury it as deep as this

sometimes not always not generally i reckon we havent got the right
place

so they chose a new spot and began again the labor dragged a little
but still they made progress they pegged away in silence for some time
finally huck leaned on his shovel swabbed the beaded drops from his
brow with his sleeve and said

where you going to dig next after we get this one

i reckon maybe well tackle the old tree thats over yonder on cardiff
hill back of the widows

i reckon thatll be a good one but wont the widow take it away from
us tom its on her land

she take it away maybe shed like to try it once whoever finds one
of these hid treasures it belongs to him it dont make any difference
whose land its on

that was satisfactory the work went on by and by huck said

blame it we must be in the wrong place again what do you think

it is mighty curious huck i dont understand it sometimes witches
interfere i reckon maybe thats whats the trouble now

shucks witches aint got no power in the daytime

well thats so i didnt think of that oh i know what the matter is
what a blamed lot of fools we are you got to find out where the shadow
of the limb falls at midnight and thats where you dig

then consound it weve fooled away all this work for nothing now hang
it all we got to come back in the night its an awful long way can
you get out

i bet i will weve got to do it tonight too because if somebody sees
these holes theyll know in a minute whats here and theyll go for it

well ill come around and maow tonight

all right lets hide the tools in the bushes

the boys were there that night about the appointed time they sat in
the shadow waiting it was a lonely place and an hour made solemn by
old traditions spirits whispered in the rustling leaves ghosts lurked
in the murky nooks the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
distance an owl answered with his sepulchral note the boys were
subdued by these solemnities and talked little by and by they judged
that twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began to
dig their hopes commenced to rise their interest grew stronger and
their industry kept pace with it the hole deepened and still deepened
but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
something they only suffered a new disappointment it was only a stone
or a chunk at last tom said

it aint any use huck were wrong again

well but we cant be wrong we spotted the shadder to a dot

i know it but then theres another thing

whats that

why we only guessed at the time like enough it was too late or too
early

huck dropped his shovel

thats it said he thats the very trouble we got to give this one
up we cant ever tell the right time and besides this kind of things
too awful here this time of night with witches and ghosts a fluttering
around so i feel as if somethings behind me all the time and im
afeard to turn around becuz maybe theres others in front a waiting for
a chance i been creeping all over ever since i got here

well ive been pretty much so too huck they most always put in a
dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree to look out for it

lordy

yes they do ive always heard that

tom i dont like to fool around much where theres dead people a
bodys bound to get into trouble with em sure

i dont like to stir em up either spose this one here was to stick
his skull out and say something

dont tom its awful

well it just is huck i dont feel comfortable a bit

say tom lets give this place up and try somewheres else

all right i reckon we better

whatll it be

tom considered awhile and then said

the hanted house thats it

blame it i dont like hanted houses tom why theyre a dern sight
worsen dead people dead people might talk maybe but they dont come
sliding around in a shroud when you aint noticing and peep over your
shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth the way a ghost does i
couldnt stand such a thing as that tom nobody could

yes but huck ghosts dont travel around only at night they wont
hender us from digging there in the daytime

well thats so but you know mighty well people dont go about that
hanted house in the day nor the night

well thats mostly because they dont like to go where a mans been
murdered anyway but nothings ever been seen around that house except
in the night just some blue lights slipping by the windows no regular
ghosts

well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around tom
you can bet theres a ghost mighty close behind it it stands to reason
becuz you know that they dont anybody but ghosts use em

yes thats so but anyway they dont come around in the daytime so
whats the use of our being afeard

well all right well tackle the hanted house if you say so but i
reckon its taking chances

they had started down the hill by this time there in the middle of the
moonlit valley below them stood the hanted house utterly isolated
its fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps the
chimney crumbled to ruin the window sashes vacant a corner of the roof
caved in the boys gazed awhile half expecting to see a blue light flit
past a window then talking in a low tone as befitted the time and the
circumstances they struck far off to the right to give the haunted
house a wide berth and took their way homeward through the woods that
adorned the rearward side of cardiff hill




chapter xvi

about noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree they had come
for their tools tom was impatient to go to the haunted house huck was
measurably so also but suddenly said

lookyhere tom do you know what day it is

tom mentally ran over the days of the week and then quickly lifted his
eyes with a startled look in them

my i never once thought of it huck

well i didnt neither but all at once it popped onto me that it was
friday

blame it a body cant be too careful huck we might a got into an
awful scrape tackling such a thing on a friday

might better say we would theres some lucky days maybe but
friday aint

any fool knows that i dont reckon you was the first that found it
out huck

well i never said i was did i and friday aint all neither i had a
rotten bad dream last night dreampt about rats

no sure sign of trouble did they fight

no

well thats good huck when they dont fight its only a sign that
theres trouble around you know all we got to do is to look mighty
sharp and keep out of it well drop this thing for today and play do
you know robin hood huck

no whos robin hood

why he was one of the greatest men that was ever in england and the
best he was a robber

cracky i wisht i was who did he rob

only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings and such like but
he never bothered the poor he loved em he always divided up with em
perfectly square

well he must a been a brick

i bet you he was huck oh he was the noblest man that ever was
they aint any such men now i can tell you he could lick any man in
england with one hand tied behind him and he could take his yew bow
and plug a ten cent piece every time a mile and a half

whats a yew bow

i dont know its some kind of a bow of course and if he hit that
dime only on the edge he would set down and cry and curse but well
play robin hood its nobby fun ill learn you

im agreed

so they played robin hood all the afternoon now and then casting a
yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
morrows prospects and possibilities there as the sun began to sink
into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows
of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of cardiff
hill

on saturday shortly after noon the boys were at the dead tree again
they had a smoke and a chat in the shade and then dug a little in their
last hole not with great hope but merely because tom said there were
so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down
within six inches of it and then somebody else had come along and
turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel the thing failed this
time however so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
that they had not trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all the
requirements that belong to the business of treasure hunting

when they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun
and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
place that they were afraid for a moment to venture in then they
crept to the door and took a trembling peep they saw a weedgrown
floorless room unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows
a ruinous staircase and here there and everywhere hung ragged and
abandoned cobwebs they presently entered softly with quickened
pulses talking in whispers ears alert to catch the slightest sound
and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat

in a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
place a critical and interested examination rather admiring their own
boldness and wondering at it too next they wanted to look upstairs
this was something like cutting off retreat but they got to daring
each other and of course there could be but one result they threw their
tools into a corner and made the ascent up there were the same signs of
decay in one corner they found a closet that promised mystery but the
promise was a fraud there was nothing in it their courage was up now
and well in hand they were about to go down and begin work when

sh said tom

what is it whispered huck blanching with fright

sh there hear it

yes oh my lets run

keep still dont you budge theyre coming right toward the door

the boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knotholes in the planking and lay waiting in a misery of fear

theyve stopped no coming here they are dont whisper another
word huck my goodness i wish i was out of this

two men entered each boy said to himself theres the old deaf and
dumb spaniard thats been about town once or twice lately never saw
tother man before

tother was a ragged unkempt creature with nothing very pleasant
in his face the spaniard was wrapped in a serape he had bushy white
whiskers long white hair flowed from under his sombrero and he wore
green goggles when they came in tother was talking in a low voice
they sat down on the ground facing the door with their backs to the
wall and the speaker continued his remarks his manner became less
guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded

no said he ive thought it all over and i dont like it its
dangerous

dangerous grunted the deaf and dumb spaniard to the vast surprise
of the boys milksop

this voice made the boys gasp and quake it was injun joes there was
silence for some time then joe said

whats any more dangerous than that job up yonder but nothings come of
it

thats different away up the river so and not another house about
twont ever be known that we tried anyway long as we didnt succeed

well whats more dangerous than coming here in the daytime anybody
would suspicion us that saw us

i know that but there warnt any other place as handy after that fool
of a job i want to quit this shanty i wanted to yesterday only it
warnt any use trying to stir out of here with those infernal boys
playing over there on the hill right in full view

those infernal boys quaked again under the inspiration of this remark
and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was friday and
concluded to wait a day they wished in their hearts they had waited a
year

the two men got out some food and made a luncheon after a long and
thoughtful silence injun joe said

look here lad you go back up the river where you belong wait there
till you hear from me ill take the chances on dropping into this town
just once more for a look well do that dangerous job after ive
spied around a little and think things look well for it then for texas
well leg it together

this was satisfactory both men presently fell to yawning and injun joe
said

im dead for sleep its your turn to watch

he curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore his comrade stirred
him once or twice and he became quiet presently the watcher began to
nod his head drooped lower and lower both men began to snore now

the boys drew a long grateful breath tom whispered

nows our chance come

huck said

i cant id die if they was to wake

tom urged huck held back at last tom rose slowly and softly and
started alone but the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright he never
made a second attempt the boys lay there counting the dragging moments
till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray
and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting

now one snore ceased injun joe sat up stared around smiled grimly upon
his comrade whose head was drooping upon his knees stirred him up with
his foot and said

here youre a watchman aint you all right though nothings
happened

my have i been asleep

oh partly partly nearly time for us to be moving pard whatll we
do with what little swag weve got left

i dont know leave it here as weve always done i reckon no use to
take it away till we start south six hundred and fifty in silvers
something to carry

well all right it wont matter to come here once more

no but id say come in the night as we used to do its better

yes but look here it may be a good while before i get the right
chance at that job accidents might happen taint in such a very good
place well just regularly bury it and bury it deep

good idea said the comrade who walked across the room knelt down
raised one of the rearward hearth stones and took out a bag that jingled
pleasantly he subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself
and as much for injun joe and passed the bag to the latter who was on
his knees in the corner now digging with his bowie knife

the boys forgot all their fears all their miseries in an instant with
gloating eyes they watched every movement luck the splendor of it was
beyond all imagination six hundred dollars was money enough to make
half a dozen boys rich here was treasure hunting under the happiest
auspices there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to
dig they nudged each other every moment eloquent nudges and easily
understood for they simply meant oh but aint you glad now were
here

joes knife struck upon something

hello said he

what is it said his comrade

half rotten plank no its a box i believe here bear a hand and well
see what its here for never mind ive broke a hole

he reached his hand in and drew it out

man its money

the two men examined the handful of coins they were gold the boys
above were as excited as themselves and as delighted

joes comrade said

well make quick work of this theres an old rusty pick over amongst
the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace i saw it a
minute ago

he ran and brought the boys pick and shovel injun joe took the
pick looked it over critically shook his head muttered something to
himself and then began to use it the box was soon unearthed it was
not very large it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
slow years had injured it the men contemplated the treasure awhile in
blissful silence

pard theres thousands of dollars here said injun joe

twas always said that murrels gang used to be around here one
summer the stranger observed

i know it said injun joe and this looks like it i should say

now you wont need to do that job

the halfbreed frowned said he

you dont know me least you dont know all about that thing taint
robbery altogether its revenge and a wicked light flamed in his
eyes ill need your help in it when its finished then texas go home
to your nance and your kids and stand by till you hear from me

well if you say so whatll we do with this bury it again

yes ravishing delight overhead no by the great sachem no
profound distress overhead id nearly forgot that pick had fresh
earth on it the boys were sick with terror in a moment what business
has a pick and a shovel here what business with fresh earth on
them who brought them here and where are they gone have you heard
anybody seen anybody what bury it again and leave them to come and
see the ground disturbed not exactly not exactly well take it to my
den

why of course might have thought of that before you mean number
one

no number two under the cross the other place is bad too common

all right its nearly dark enough to start

injun joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping
out presently he said

who could have brought those tools here do you reckon they can be
upstairs

the boys breath forsook them injun joe put his hand on his knife
halted a moment undecided and then turned toward the stairway the
boys thought of the closet but their strength was gone the steps came
creaking up the stairs the intolerable distress of the situation woke
the stricken resolution of the lads they were about to spring for the
closet when there was a crash of rotten timbers and injun joe landed on
the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway he gathered himself
up cursing and his comrade said

now whats the use of all that if its anybody and theyre up there
let them stay there who cares if they want to jump down now and get
into trouble who objects it will be dark in fifteen minutes and then
let them follow us if they want to im willing in my opinion whoever
hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or
devils or something ill bet theyre running yet

joe grumbled awhile then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving
shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening
twilight and moved toward the river with their precious box

tom and huck rose up weak but vastly relieved and stared after them
through the chinks between the logs of the house follow not they they
were content to reach ground again without broken necks and take the
townward track over the hill they did not talk much they were too much
absorbed in hating themselves hating the ill luck that made them take
the spade and the pick there but for that injun joe never would have
suspected he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait
there till his revenge was satisfied and then he would have had the
misfortune to find that money turn up missing bitter bitter luck that
the tools were ever brought there

they resolved to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come to
town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job and follow him to
number two wherever that might be then a ghastly thought occurred to
tom

revenge what if he means us huck

oh dont said huck nearly fainting

they talked it all over and as they entered town they agreed to believe
that he might possibly mean somebody else at least that he might at
least mean nobody but tom since only tom had testified

very very small comfort it was to tom to be alone in danger company
would be a palpable improvement he thought




chapter xxvii

the adventure of the day mightily tormented toms dreams that night
four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times
it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune as he lay
in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure he
noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away somewhat as if
they had happened in another world or in a time long gone by then it
occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream there
was one very strong argument in favor of this idea namely that the
quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real he had never seen
as much as fifty dollars in one mass before and he was like all boys of
his age and station in life in that he imagined that all references to
hundreds and thousands were mere fanciful forms of speech and that
no such sums really existed in the world he never had supposed for
a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in
actual money in any ones possession if his notions of hidden treasure
had been analyzed they would have been found to consist of a handful of
real dimes and a bushel of vague splendid ungraspable dollars

but the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
under the attrition of thinking them over and so he presently found
himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
dream after all this uncertainty must be swept away he would snatch a
hurried breakfast and go and find huck huck was sitting on the gunwale
of a flatboat listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking
very melancholy tom concluded to let huck lead up to the subject if
he did not do it then the adventure would be proved to have been only a
dream

hello huck

hello yourself

silence for a minute

tom if wed a left the blame tools at the dead tree wed a got
the money oh aint it awful

taint a dream then taint a dream somehow i most wish it was
dogd if i dont huck

what aint a dream

oh that thing yesterday i been half thinking it was

dream if them stairs hadnt broke down youd a seen how much dream
it was ive had dreams enough all night with that patch eyed spanish
devil going for me all through em rot him

no not rot him find him track the money

tom well never find him a feller dont have only one chance for such
a pile and that ones lost id feel mighty shaky if i was to see him
anyway

well sod i but id like to see him anyway and track him out to his
number two

number two yes thats it i been thinking bout that but i cant make
nothing out of it what do you reckon it is

i dono its too deep say huck maybe its the number of a house

goody no tom that aint it if it is it aint in this one horse
town they aint no numbers here

well thats so lemme think a minute here its the number of a
room in a tavern you know

oh thats the trick they aint only two taverns we can find out
quick

you stay here huck till i come

tom was off at once he did not care to have hucks company in public
places he was gone half an hour he found that in the best tavern no
had long been occupied by a young lawyer and was still so occupied
in the less ostentatious house no was a mystery the tavern keepers
young son said it was kept locked all the time and he never saw anybody
go into it or come out of it except at night he did not know any
particular reason for this state of things had had some little
curiosity but it was rather feeble had made the most of the mystery
by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was hanted had
noticed that there was a light in there the night before

thats what ive found out huck i reckon thats the very no were
after

i reckon it is tom now what you going to do

lemme think

tom thought a long time then he said

ill tell you the back door of that no is the door that comes out
into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
of a brick store now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find and
ill nip all of aunties and the first dark night well go there and
try em and mind you keep a lookout for injun joe because he said he
was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get
his revenge if you see him you just follow him and if he dont go to
that no that aint the place

lordy i dont want to foller him by myself

why itll be night sure he mightnt ever see you and if he did
maybe hed never think anything

well if its pretty dark i reckon ill track him i dono i dono ill
try

you bet ill follow him if its dark huck why he might a found
out he couldnt get his revenge and be going right after that money

its so tom its so ill foller him i will by jingoes

now youre talking dont you ever weaken huck and i wont




chapter xxviii

that night tom and huck were ready for their adventure they hung about
the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine one watching the alley
at a distance and the other the tavern door nobody entered the alley or
left it nobody resembling the spaniard entered or left the tavern
door the night promised to be a fair one so tom went home with the
understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on huck
was to come and maow whereupon he would slip out and try the keys
but the night remained clear and huck closed his watch and retired to
bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve

tuesday the boys had the same ill luck also wednesday but thursday
night promised better tom slipped out in good season with his aunts
old tin lantern and a large towel to blindfold it with he hid the
lantern in hucks sugar hogshead and the watch began an hour before
midnight the tavern closed up and its lights the only ones thereabouts
were put out no spaniard had been seen nobody had entered or left the
alley everything was auspicious the blackness of darkness reigned
the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of
distant thunder

tom got his lantern lit it in the hogshead wrapped it closely in the
towel and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern
huck stood sentry and tom felt his way into the alley then there was
a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon hucks spirits like a
mountain he began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern it
would frighten him but it would at least tell him that tom was alive
yet it seemed hours since tom had disappeared surely he must have
fainted maybe he was dead maybe his heart had burst under terror and
excitement in his uneasiness huck found himself drawing closer
and closer to the alley fearing all sorts of dreadful things and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
his breath there was not much to take away for he seemed only able to
inhale it by thimblefuls and his heart would soon wear itself out the
way it was beating suddenly there was a flash of light and tom came
tearing by him run said he run for your life

he neednt have repeated it once was enough huck was making thirty or
forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered the boys never
stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter house at the
lower end of the village just as they got within its shelter the storm
burst and the rain poured down as soon as tom got his breath he said

huck it was awful i tried two of the keys just as soft as i could
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that i couldnt hardly
get my breath i was so scared they wouldnt turn in the lock either
well without noticing what i was doing i took hold of the knob and
open comes the door it warnt locked i hopped in and shook off the
towel and great caesars ghost

what whatd you see tom

huck i most stepped onto injun joes hand

no

yes he was lying there sound asleep on the floor with his old patch
on his eye and his arms spread out

lordy what did you do did he wake up

no never budged drunk i reckon i just grabbed that towel and
started

id never a thought of the towel i bet

well i would my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it

say tom did you see that box

huck i didnt wait to look around i didnt see the box i didnt see
the cross i didnt see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor
by injun joe yes i saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room
dont you see now whats the matter with that hanted room

how

why its hanted with whiskey maybe all the temperance taverns have
got a hanted room hey huck

well i reckon maybe thats so whod a thought such a thing but
say tom nows a mighty good time to get that box if injun joes
drunk

it is that you try it

huck shuddered

well no i reckon not

and i reckon not huck only one bottle alongside of injun joe aint
enough if thered been three hed be drunk enough and id do it

there was a long pause for reflection and then tom said

lookyhere huck less not try that thing any more till we know injun
joes not in there its too scary now if we watch every night well
be dead sure to see him go out some time or other and then well
snatch that box quickern lightning

well im agreed ill watch the whole night long and ill do it every
night too if youll do the other part of the job

all right i will all you got to do is to trot up hooper street a
block and maow and if im asleep you throw some gravel at the window
and thatll fetch me

agreed and good as wheat

now huck the storms over and ill go home itll begin to be
daylight in a couple of hours you go back and watch that long will

he wouldnt want to do as a steady thing

well if i dont want you in the daytime ill let you sleep i wont
come bothering around any time you see somethings up in the night
just skip right around and maow




chapter xxix

the first thing tom heard on friday morning was a glad piece of
news judge thatchers family had come back to town the night before
both injun joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
moment and becky took the chief place in the boys interest he saw her
and they had an exhausting good time playing hispy and gully keeper
with a crowd of their schoolmates the day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory way becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long promised and long delayed picnic and she
consented the childs delight was boundless and toms not more
moderate the invitations were sent out before sunset and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable anticipation toms excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour and he had good hopes of hearing hucks
maow and of having his treasure to astonish becky and the picnickers
with next day but he was disappointed no signal came that night

morning came eventually and by ten or eleven oclock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at judge thatchers and everything was
ready for a start it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their presence the children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty three or thereabouts the old steam ferry boat was
chartered for the occasion presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with provision baskets sid was sick and had to miss
the fun mary remained at home to entertain him the last thing mrs
thatcher said to becky was

youll not get back till late perhaps youd better stay all night with
some of the girls that live near the ferry landing child

then ill stay with susy harper mamma

very well and mind and behave yourself and dont be any trouble

presently as they tripped along tom said to becky

say ill tell you what well do stead of going to joe harpers well
climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglas shell have
ice cream she has it most every day dead loads of it and shell be
awful glad to have us

oh that will be fun

then becky reflected a moment and said

but what will mamma say

howll she ever know

the girl turned the idea over in her mind and said reluctantly

i reckon its wrong but

but shucks your mother wont know and so whats the harm all she
wants is that youll be safe and i bet you shed a said go there if
shed a thought of it i know she would

the widow douglas splendid hospitality was a tempting bait it and
toms persuasions presently carried the day so it was decided to say
nothing to anybody about the nights programme presently it occurred to
tom that maybe huck might come this very night and give the signal the
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations still he
could not bear to give up the fun at widow douglas and why should he
give it up he reasoned the signal did not come the night before so
why should it be any more likely to come tonight the sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain treasure and boy like he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that day

three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied up the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
laughter all the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through with and by and by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible appetites and then the destruction of the good things
began after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
the shade of spreading oaks by and by somebody shouted

whos ready for the cave

everybody was bundles of candles were procured and straightway there
was a general scamper up the hill the mouth of the cave was up the
hillside an opening shaped like a letter a its massive oaken door stood
unbarred within was a small chamber chilly as an icehouse and walled
by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat it was
romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out
upon the green valley shining in the sun but the impressiveness of the
situation quickly wore off and the romping began again the moment
a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it a
struggle and a gallant defence followed but the candle was soon knocked
down or blown out and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a
new chase but all things have an end by and by the procession went
filing down the steep descent of the main avenue the flickering rank of
lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of
junction sixty feet overhead this main avenue was not more than
eight or ten feet wide every few steps other lofty and still narrower
crevices branched from it on either hand for mcdougals cave was but a
vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again
and led nowhere it was said that one might wander days and nights
together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms and never
find the end of the cave and that he might go down and down and
still down into the earth and it was just the same labyrinth under
labyrinth and no end to any of them no man knew the cave that was
an impossible thing most of the young men knew a portion of it and it
was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion tom sawyer
knew as much of the cave as any one

the procession moved along the main avenue some three quarters of
a mile and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues fly along the dismal corridors and take each other by surprise
at points where the corridors joined again parties were able to elude
each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
known ground

by and by one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave panting hilarious smeared from head to foot with tallow
drippings daubed with clay and entirely delighted with the success of
the day then they were astonished to find that they had been taking
no note of time and that night was about at hand the clanging bell had
been calling for half an hour however this sort of close to the days
adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory when the ferryboat
with her wild freight pushed into the stream nobody cared sixpence for
the wasted time but the captain of the craft

huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboats lights went
glinting past the wharf he heard no noise on board for the young
people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
tired to death he wondered what boat it was and why she did not
stop at the wharf and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
attention upon his business the night was growing cloudy and dark ten
oclock came and the noise of vehicles ceased scattered lights began
to wink out all straggling foot passengers disappeared the village
betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
silence and the ghosts eleven oclock came and the tavern lights were
put out darkness everywhere now huck waited what seemed a weary long
time but nothing happened his faith was weakening was there any use
was there really any use why not give it up and turn in

a noise fell upon his ear he was all attention in an instant the alley
door closed softly he sprang to the corner of the brick store the next
moment two men brushed by him and one seemed to have something under
his arm it must be that box so they were going to remove the treasure
why call tom now it would be absurd the men would get away with the box
and never be found again no he would stick to their wake and follow
them he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery so
communing with himself huck stepped out and glided along behind the
men cat like with bare feet allowing them to keep just far enough
ahead not to be invisible

they moved up the river street three blocks then turned to the left up
a crossstreet they went straight ahead then until they came to the
path that led up cardiff hill this they took they passed by the old
welshmans house halfway up the hill without hesitating and still
climbed upward good thought huck they will bury it in the old quarry
but they never stopped at the quarry they passed on up the summit
they plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes and
were at once hidden in the gloom huck closed up and shortened his
distance now for they would never be able to see him he trotted along
awhile then slackened his pace fearing he was gaining too fast moved
on a piece then stopped altogether listened no sound none save that
he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart the hooting of an
owl came over the hill ominous sound but no footsteps heavens was
everything lost he was about to spring with winged feet when a man
cleared his throat not four feet from him hucks heart shot into his
throat but he swallowed it again and then he stood there shaking as
if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once and so weak that he
thought he must surely fall to the ground he knew where he was he
knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into widow douglas
grounds very well he thought let them bury it there it wont be hard
to find

now there was a voice a very low voice injun joes

damn her maybe shes got company theres lights late as it is

i cant see any

this was that strangers voice the stranger of the haunted house a
deadly chill went to hucks heart this then was the revenge job his
thought was to fly then he remembered that the widow douglas had been
kind to him more than once and maybe these men were going to murder
her he wished he dared venture to warn her but he knew he didnt
dare they might come and catch him he thought all this and more in
the moment that elapsed between the strangers remark and injun joes
next which was

because the bush is in your way now this way now you see dont you

yes well there is company there i reckon better give it up

give it up and i just leaving this country forever give it up and
maybe never have another chance i tell you again as ive told you
before i dont care for her swag you may have it but her husband was
rough on me many times he was rough on me and mainly he was the justice
of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant and that aint all it aint
a millionth part of it he had me horsewhipped horsewhipped in
front of the jail like a nigger with all the town looking on
horsewhipped do you understand he took advantage of me and died but
ill take it out of her

oh dont kill her dont do that

kill who said anything about killing i would kill him if he was
here but not her when you want to get revenge on a woman you dont
kill her bosh you go for her looks you slit her nostrils you notch her
ears like a sow

by god thats

keep your opinion to yourself it will be safest for you ill tie her
to the bed if she bleeds to death is that my fault ill not cry if
she does my friend youll help me in this thing for my sake thats
why youre here i mightnt be able alone if you flinch ill kill you
do you understand that and if i have to kill you ill kill her and
then i reckon nobodyll ever know much about who done this business

well if its got to be done lets get at it the quicker the
better im all in a shiver

do it now and company there look here ill get suspicious of you
first thing you know no well wait till the lights are out theres no
hurry

huck felt that a silence was going to ensue a thing still more awful
than any amount of murderous talk so he held his breath and stepped
gingerly back planted his foot carefully and firmly after balancing
one legged in a precarious way and almost toppling over first on one
side and then on the other he took another step back with the same
elaboration and the same risks then another and another and a twig
snapped under his foot his breath stopped and he listened there was no
sound the stillness was perfect his gratitude was measureless now he
turned in his tracks between the walls of sumach bushes turned
himself as carefully as if he were a ship and then stepped quickly but
cautiously along when he emerged at the quarry he felt secure and
so he picked up his nimble heels and flew down down he sped till he
reached the welshmans he banged at the door and presently the heads
of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows

whats the row there whos banging what do you want

let me in quick ill tell everything

why who are you

huckleberry finn quick let me in

huckleberry finn indeed it aint a name to open many doors i judge
but let him in lads and lets see whats the trouble

please dont ever tell i told you were hucks first words when he got
in please dont id be killed sure but the widows been good friends
to me sometimes and i want to tell i will tell if youll promise you
wont ever say it was me

by george he has got something to tell or he wouldnt act so
exclaimed the old man out with it and nobody herell ever tell lad

three minutes later the old man and his sons well armed were up the
hill and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe their weapons in
their hands huck accompanied them no further he hid behind a great
bowlder and fell to listening there was a lagging anxious silence and
then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry

huck waited for no particulars he sprang away and sped down the hill as
fast as his legs could carry him




chapter xxx

as the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on sunday morning huck came
groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old welshmans door the
inmates were asleep but it was a sleep that was set on a hair trigger
on account of the exciting episode of the night a call came from a
window

whos there

hucks scared voice answered in a low tone

please let me in its only huck finn

its a name that can open this door night or day lad and welcome

these were strange words to the vagabond boys ears and the pleasantest
he had ever heard he could not recollect that the closing word had ever
been applied in his case before the door was quickly unlocked and he
entered huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall
sons speedily dressed themselves

now my boy i hope youre good and hungry because breakfast will be
ready as soon as the suns up and well have a piping hot one too make
yourself easy about that i and the boys hoped youd turn up and stop
here last night

i was awful scared said huck and i run i took out when the pistols
went off and i didnt stop for three mile ive come now becuz i wanted
to know about it you know and i come before daylight becuz i didnt
want to run across them devils even if they was dead

well poor chap you do look as if youd had a hard night of it but
theres a bed here for you when youve had your breakfast no they
aint dead lad we are sorry enough for that you see we knew right
where to put our hands on them by your description so we crept along
on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them dark as a cellar that
sumach path was and just then i found i was going to sneeze it was the
meanest kind of luck i tried to keep it back but no use twas bound to
come and it did come i was in the lead with my pistol raised and when
the sneeze started those scoundrels a rustling to get out of the path
i sung out fire boys and blazed away at the place where the rustling
was so did the boys but they were off in a jiffy those villains and
we after them down through the woods i judge we never touched them
they fired a shot apiece as they started but their bullets whizzed by
and didnt do us any harm as soon as we lost the sound of their feet
we quit chasing and went down and stirred up the constables they got a
posse together and went off to guard the river bank and as soon as it
is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods my boys
will be with them presently i wish we had some sort of description of
those rascals twould help a good deal but you couldnt see what they
were like in the dark lad i suppose

oh yes i saw them downtown and follered them

splendid describe them describe them my boy

ones the old deaf and dumb spaniard thats ben around here once or
twice and tothers a mean looking ragged

thats enough lad we know the men happened on them in the woods back
of the widows one day and they slunk away off with you boys and
tell the sheriff get your breakfast tomorrow morning

the welshmans sons departed at once as they were leaving the room huck
sprang up and exclaimed

oh please dont tell any body it was me that blowed on them oh
please

all right if you say it huck but you ought to have the credit of what
you did

oh no no please dont tell

when the young men were gone the old welshman said

they wont tell and i wont but why dont you want it known

huck would not explain further than to say that he already knew too
much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew
anything against him for the whole world he would be killed for knowing
it sure

the old man promised secrecy once more and said

how did you come to follow these fellows lad were they looking
suspicious

huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply then he said

well you see im a kind of a hard lot least everybody says so and
i dont see nothing agin it and sometimes i cant sleep much on account
of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of
doing that was the way of it last night i couldnt sleep and so i
come along upstreet bout midnight a turning it all over and when i
got to that old shackly brick store by the temperance tavern i backed
up agin the wall to have another think well just then along comes
these two chaps slipping along close by me with something under their
arm and i reckoned theyd stole it one was a smoking and tother one
wanted a light so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
their faces and i see that the big one was the deaf and dumb spaniard
by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye and tother one was a
rusty ragged looking devil

could you see the rags by the light of the cigars

this staggered huck for a moment then he said

well i dont know but somehow it seems as if i did

then they went on and you

follered em yes that was it i wanted to see what was up they sneaked
along so i dogged em to the widders stile and stood in the dark and
heard the ragged one beg for the widder and the spaniard swear hed
spile her looks just as i told you and your two

what the deaf and dumb man said all that

huck had made another terrible mistake he was trying his best to keep
the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the spaniard might be
and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of
all he could do he made several efforts to creep out of his scrape
but the old mans eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder
presently the welshman said

my boy dont be afraid of me i wouldnt hurt a hair of your head for
all the world no id protect you id protect you this spaniard is
not deaf and dumb youve let that slip without intending it you cant
cover that up now you know something about that spaniard that you want
to keep dark now trust me tell me what it is and trust me i wont
betray you

huck looked into the old mans honest eyes a moment then bent over and
whispered in his ear

taint a spaniard its injun joe

the welshman almost jumped out of his chair in a moment he said

its all plain enough now when you talked about notching ears and
slitting noses i judged that that was your own embellishment because
white men dont take that sort of revenge but an injun thats a
different matter altogether

during breakfast the talk went on and in the course of it the old man
said that the last thing which he and his sons had done before going
to bed was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
marks of blood they found none but captured a bulky bundle of

of what

if the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
stunning suddenness from hucks blanched lips his eyes were staring
wide now and his breath suspended waiting for the answer the welshman
started stared in return three seconds five seconds ten then replied

of burglars tools why whats the matter with you

huck sank back panting gently but deeply unutterably grateful the
welshman eyed him gravely curiously and presently said

yes burglars tools that appears to relieve you a good deal but what
did give you that turn what were you expecting wed found

huck was in a close place the inquiring eye was upon him he would have
given anything for material for a plausible answer nothing suggested
itself the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper a senseless
reply offered there was no time to weigh it so at a venture he uttered
it feebly

sunday school books maybe

poor huck was too distressed to smile but the old man laughed loud and
joyously shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot and
ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a mans pocket because
it cut down the doctors bill like everything then he added

poor old chap youre white and jaded you aint well a bit no wonder
youre a little flighty and off your balance but youll come out of it
rest and sleep will fetch you out all right i hope

huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
a suspicious excitement for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
brought from the tavern was the treasure as soon as he had heard the
talk at the widows stile he had only thought it was not the treasure
however he had not known that it wasnt and so the suggestion of a
captured bundle was too much for his self possession but on the whole
he felt glad the little episode had happened for now he knew beyond all
question that that bundle was not the bundle and so his mind was
at rest and exceedingly comfortable in fact everything seemed to be
drifting just in the right direction now the treasure must be still
in no the men would be captured and jailed that day and he and
tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
interruption

just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door huck
jumped for a hiding place for he had no mind to be connected even
remotely with the late event the welshman admitted several ladies and
gentlemen among them the widow douglas and noticed that groups of
citizens were climbing up the hill to stare at the stile so the news
had spread the welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
visitors the widows gratitude for her preservation was outspoken

dont say a word about it madam theres another that youre more
beholden to than you are to me and my boys maybe but he dont allow me
to tell his name we wouldnt have been there but for him

of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the
main matter but the welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
visitors and through them be transmitted to the whole town for he
refused to part with his secret when all else had been learned the
widow said

i went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
noise why didnt you come and wake me

we judged it warnt worth while those fellows warnt likely to come
again they hadnt any tools left to work with and what was the use of
waking you up and scaring you to death my three negro men stood guard
at your house all the rest of the night theyve just come back

more visitors came and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
of hours more

there was no sabbath school during day school vacation but everybody
was early at church the stirring event was well canvassed news came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered when the
sermon was finished judge thatchers wife dropped alongside of mrs
harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said

is my becky going to sleep all day i just expected she would be tired
to death

your becky

yes with a startled look didnt she stay with you last night

why no

mrs thatcher turned pale and sank into a pew just as aunt polly
talking briskly with a friend passed by aunt polly said

goodmorning mrs thatcher goodmorning mrs harper ive got a boy
thats turned up missing i reckon my tom stayed at your house last
night one of you and now hes afraid to come to church ive got to
settle with him

mrs thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever

he didnt stay with us said mrs harper beginning to look uneasy a
marked anxiety came into aunt pollys face

joe harper have you seen my tom this morning

nom

when did you see him last

joe tried to remember but was not sure he could say the people had
stopped moving out of church whispers passed along and a boding
uneasiness took possession of every countenance children were anxiously
questioned and young teachers they all said they had not noticed
whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip
it was dark no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing one
young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave
mrs thatcher swooned away aunt polly fell to crying and wringing her
hands

the alarm swept from lip to lip from group to group from street to
street and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and
the whole town was up the cardiff hill episode sank into instant
insignificance the burglars were forgotten horses were saddled skiffs
were manned the ferryboat ordered out and before the horror was half
an hour old two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
the cave

all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead many women
visited aunt polly and mrs thatcher and tried to comfort them they
cried with them too and that was still better than words all the
tedious night the town waited for news but when the morning dawned at
last all the word that came was send more candles and send food
mrs thatcher was almost crazed and aunt polly also judge thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave but they conveyed
no real cheer

the old welshman came home toward daylight spattered with
candle grease smeared with clay and almost worn out he found huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him and delirious with
fever the physicians were all at the cave so the widow douglas came
and took charge of the patient she said she would do her best by him
because whether he was good bad or indifferent he was the lords
and nothing that was the lords was a thing to be neglected the
welshman said huck had good spots in him and the widow said

you can depend on it thats the lords mark he dont leave it off
he never does puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
hands

early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
village but the strongest of the citizens continued searching all the
news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being
ransacked that had never been visited before that every corner and
crevice was going to be thoroughly searched that wherever one wandered
through the maze of passages lights were to be seen flitting hither
and thither in the distance and shoutings and pistol shots sent their
hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles in one place
far from the section usually traversed by tourists the names becky
tom had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle smoke and
near at hand a grease soiled bit of ribbon mrs thatcher recognized the
ribbon and cried over it she said it was the last relic she should ever
have of her child and that no other memorial of her could ever be so
precious because this one parted latest from the living body before the
awful death came some said that now and then in the cave a far away
speck of light would glimmer and then a glorious shout would burst
forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle and then a
sickening disappointment always followed the children were not there
it was only a searchers light

three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along and
the village sank into a hopeless stupor no one had heart for anything
the accidental discovery just made that the proprietor of the
temperance tavern kept liquor on his premises scarcely fluttered the
public pulse tremendous as the fact was in a lucid interval huck
feebly led up to the subject of taverns and finally asked dimly
dreading the worst if anything had been discovered at the temperance
tavern since he had been ill

yes said the widow

huck started up in bed wildeyed

what what was it

liquor and the place has been shut up lie down child what a turn you
did give me

only tell me just one thing only just one please was it tom sawyer
that found it

the widow burst into tears hush hush child hush ive told you
before you must not talk you are very very sick

then nothing but liquor had been found there would have been a great
powwow if it had been the gold so the treasure was gone forever gone
forever but what could she be crying about curious that she should
cry

these thoughts worked their dim way through hucks mind and under the
weariness they gave him he fell asleep the widow said to herself

there hes asleep poor wreck tom sawyer find it pity but somebody
could find tom sawyer ah there aint many left now thats got hope
enough or strength enough either to go on searching




chapter xxxi

now to return to tom and beckys share in the picnic they tripped along
the murky aisles with the rest of the company visiting the familiar
wonders of the cave wonders dubbed with rather over descriptive names
such as the drawing room the cathedral aladdins palace and
so on presently the hide and seek frolicking began and tom and becky
engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle
wearisome then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their
candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names dates
postoffice addresses and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been
frescoed in candle smoke still drifting along and talking they
scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls
were not frescoed they smoked their own names under an overhanging
shelf and moved on presently they came to a place where a little stream
of water trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with
it had in the slow dragging ages formed a laced and ruffled niagara
in gleaming and imperishable stone tom squeezed his small body behind
it in order to illuminate it for beckys gratification he found that
it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between
narrow walls and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him

becky responded to his call and they made a smoke mark for future
guidance and started upon their quest they wound this way and that
far down into the secret depths of the cave made another mark and
branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about in
one place they found a spacious cavern from whose ceiling depended a
multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of
a mans leg they walked all about it wondering and admiring and
presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into
it this shortly brought them to a bewitching spring whose basin was
incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals it was in the midst
of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which
had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites
together the result of the ceaseless water drip of centuries under the
roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together thousands in a
bunch the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by
hundreds squeaking and darting furiously at the candles tom knew their
ways and the danger of this sort of conduct he seized beckys hand and
hurried her into the first corridor that offered and none too soon for
a bat struck beckys light out with its wing while she was passing out
of the cavern the bats chased the children a good distance but the
fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered and at last got
rid of the perilous things tom found a subterranean lake shortly
which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the
shadows he wanted to explore its borders but concluded that it would
be best to sit down and rest awhile first now for the first time the
deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
children becky said

why i didnt notice but it seems ever so long since i heard any of
the others

come to think becky we are away down below them and i dont know how
far away north or south or east or whichever it is we couldnt hear
them here

becky grew apprehensive

i wonder how long weve been down here tom we better start back

yes i reckon we better praps we better

can you find the way tom its all a mixed up crookedness to me

i reckon i could find it but then the bats if they put our candles
out it will be an awful fix lets try some other way so as not to go
through there

well but i hope we wont get lost it would be so awful and the girl
shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities

they started through a corridor and traversed it in silence a long
way glancing at each new opening to see if there was anything familiar
about the look of it but they were all strange every time tom made an
examination becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign and he
would say cheerily

oh its all right this aint the one but well come to it right
away

but he felt less and less hopeful with each failure and presently began
to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random in desperate hope of
finding the one that was wanted he still said it was all right but
there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their
ring and sounded just as if he had said all is lost becky clung to
his side in an anguish of fear and tried hard to keep back the tears
but they would come at last she said

oh tom never mind the bats lets go back that way we seem to get
worse and worse off all the time

listen said he

profound silence silence so deep that even their breathings were
conspicuous in the hush tom shouted the call went echoing down
the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
resembled a ripple of mocking laughter

oh dont do it again tom it is too horrid said becky

it is horrid but i better becky they might hear us you know and
he shouted again

the might was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter it so
confessed a perishing hope the children stood still and listened but
there was no result tom turned upon the back track at once and hurried
his steps it was but a little while before a certain indecision in his
manner revealed another fearful fact to becky he could not find his way
back

oh tom you didnt make any marks

becky i was such a fool such a fool i never thought we might want to
come back no i cant find the way its all mixed up

tom tom were lost were lost we never can get out of this awful
place oh why did we ever leave the others

she sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that tom
was appalled with the idea that she might die or lose her reason he
sat down by her and put his arms around her she buried her face in
his bosom she clung to him she poured out her terrors her unavailing
regrets and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter tom
begged her to pluck up hope again and she said she could not he fell
to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable
situation this had a better effect she said she would try to hope
again she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
would not talk like that any more for he was no more to blame than she
she said

so they moved on again aimlessly simply at random all they could do
was to move keep moving for a little while hope made a show of
reviving not with any reason to back it but only because it is its
nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and
familiarity with failure

by and by tom took beckys candle and blew it out this economy meant so
much words were not needed becky understood and her hope died again
she knew that tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his
pockets yet he must economize

by and by fatigue began to assert its claims the children tried to pay
attention for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was
grown to be so precious moving in some direction in any direction
was at least progress and might bear fruit but to sit down was to
invite death and shorten its pursuit

at last beckys frail limbs refused to carry her farther she sat down
tom rested with her and they talked of home and the friends there
and the comfortable beds and above all the light becky cried and tom
tried to think of some way of comforting her but all his encouragements
were grown thread bare with use and sounded like sarcasms fatigue bore
so heavily upon becky that she drowsed off to sleep tom was grateful
he sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural
under the influence of pleasant dreams and by and by a smile dawned and
rested there the peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing
into his own spirit and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and
dreamy memories while he was deep in his musings becky woke up with a
breezy little laugh but it was stricken dead upon her lips and a groan
followed it

oh how could i sleep i wish i never never had waked no no i
dont tom dont look so i wont say it again

im glad youve slept becky youll feel rested now and well find
the way out

we can try tom but ive seen such a beautiful country in my dream i
reckon we are going there

maybe not maybe not cheer up becky and lets go on trying

they rose up and wandered along hand in hand and hopeless they tried
to estimate how long they had been in the cave but all they knew was
that it seemed days and weeks and yet it was plain that this could not
be for their candles were not gone yet a long time after this they
could not tell how long tom said they must go softly and listen for
dripping water they must find a spring they found one presently and
tom said it was time to rest again both were cruelly tired yet becky
said she thought she could go a little farther she was surprised to
hear tom dissent she could not understand it they sat down and tom
fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay thought
was soon busy nothing was said for some time then becky broke the
silence

tom i am so hungry

tom took something out of his pocket

do you remember this said he

becky almost smiled

its our wedding cake tom

yes i wish it was as big as a barrel for its all weve got

i saved it from the picnic for us to dream on tom the way grownup
people do with wedding cake but itll be our

she dropped the sentence where it was tom divided the cake and becky
ate with good appetite while tom nibbled at his moiety there was
abundance of cold water to finish the feast with by and by becky
suggested that they move on again tom was silent a moment then he
said

becky can you bear it if i tell you something

beckys face paled but she thought she could

well then becky we must stay here where theres water to drink
that little piece is our last candle

becky gave loose to tears and wailings tom did what he could to comfort
her but with little effect at length becky said

tom

well becky

theyll miss us and hunt for us

yes they will certainly they will

maybe theyre hunting for us now tom

why i reckon maybe they are i hope they are

when would they miss us tom

when they get back to the boat i reckon

tom it might be dark then would they notice we hadnt come

i dont know but anyway your mother would miss you as soon as they
got home

a frightened look in beckys face brought tom to his senses and he saw
that he had made a blunder becky was not to have gone home that night
the children became silent and thoughtful in a moment a new burst of
grief from becky showed tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers
also that the sabbath morning might be half spent before mrs thatcher
discovered that becky was not at mrs harpers

the children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it
melt slowly and pitilessly away saw the half inch of wick stand alone
at last saw the feeble flame rise and fall climb the thin column of
smoke linger at its top a moment and then the horror of utter darkness
reigned

how long afterward it was that becky came to a slow consciousness that
she was crying in toms arms neither could tell all that they knew
was that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time both awoke out of
a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more tom said
it might be sunday now maybe monday he tried to get becky to talk but
her sorrows were too oppressive all her hopes were gone tom said that
they must have been missed long ago and no doubt the search was going
on he would shout and maybe some one would come he tried it but in
the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no
more

the hours wasted away and hunger came to torment the captives again a
portion of toms half of the cake was left they divided and ate it but
they seemed hungrier than before the poor morsel of food only whetted
desire

by and by tom said

sh did you hear that

both held their breath and listened there was a sound like the
faintest far off shout instantly tom answered it and leading becky by
the hand started groping down the corridor in its direction presently
he listened again again the sound was heard and apparently a little
nearer

its them said tom theyre coming come along becky were all
right now

the joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming their speed was slow
however because pitfalls were somewhat common and had to be guarded
against they shortly came to one and had to stop it might be three
feet deep it might be a hundred there was no passing it at any rate
tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could no
bottom they must stay there and wait until the searchers came they
listened evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant
a moment or two more and they had gone altogether the heart sinking
misery of it tom whooped until he was hoarse but it was of no use he
talked hopefully to becky but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
sounds came again

the children groped their way back to the spring the weary time dragged
on they slept again and awoke famished and woe stricken tom believed
it must be tuesday by this time

now an idea struck him there were some side passages near at hand it
would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
heavy time in idleness he took a kite line from his pocket tied it to
a projection and he and becky started tom in the lead unwinding the
line as he groped along at the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
in a jumping off place tom got down on his knees and felt below
and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
conveniently he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the
right and at that moment not twenty yards away a human hand holding
a candle appeared from behind a rock tom lifted up a glorious shout
and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to injun
joes tom was paralyzed he could not move he was vastly gratified the
next moment to see the spaniard take to his heels and get himself out
of sight tom wondered that joe had not recognized his voice and come
over and killed him for testifying in court but the echoes must have
disguised the voice without doubt that was it he reasoned toms
fright weakened every muscle in his body he said to himself that if he
had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there and
nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting injun joe again he
was careful to keep from becky what it was he had seen he told her he
had only shouted for luck

but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run
another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
changes the children awoke tortured with a raging hunger tom believed
that it must be wednesday or thursday or even friday or saturday now
and that the search had been given over he proposed to explore another
passage he felt willing to risk injun joe and all other terrors but
becky was very weak she had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be
roused she said she would wait now where she was and die it would
not be long she told tom to go with the kite line and explore if he
chose but she implored him to come back every little while and speak
to her and she made him promise that when the awful time came he would
stay by her and hold her hand until all was over

tom kissed her with a choking sensation in his throat and made a show
of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave
then he took the kite line in his hand and went groping down one of the
passages on his hands and knees distressed with hunger and sick with
bodings of coming doom




chapter xxxii

tuesday afternoon came and waned to the twilight the village of st
petersburg still mourned the lost children had not been found public
prayers had been offered up for them and many and many a private prayer
that had the petitioners whole heart in it but still no good news came
from the cave the majority of the searchers had given up the quest
and gone back to their daily avocations saying that it was plain the
children could never be found mrs thatcher was very ill and a great
part of the time delirious people said it was heartbreaking to hear her
call her child and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time
then lay it wearily down again with a moan aunt polly had drooped into
a settled melancholy and her gray hair had grown almost white the
village went to its rest on tuesday night sad and forlorn

away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
bells and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half clad
people who shouted turn out turn out theyre found theyre found
tin pans and horns were added to the din the population massed itself
and moved toward the river met the children coming in an open carriage
drawn by shouting citizens thronged around it joined its homeward
march and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after
huzzah

the village was illuminated nobody went to bed again it was the
greatest night the little town had ever seen during the first half hour
a procession of villagers filed through judge thatchers house seized
the saved ones and kissed them squeezed mrs thatchers hand tried to
speak but couldnt and drifted out raining tears all over the place

aunt pollys happiness was complete and mrs thatchers nearly so it
would be complete however as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
great news to the cave should get the word to her husband tom lay upon
a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the
wonderful adventure putting in many striking additions to adorn it
withal and closed with a description of how he left becky and went
on an exploring expedition how he followed two avenues as far as his
kite line would reach how he followed a third to the fullest stretch
of the kite line and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far off
speck that looked like daylight dropped the line and groped toward it
pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole and saw the broad
mississippi rolling by

and if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that
speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more he
told how he went back for becky and broke the good news and she told
him not to fret her with such stuff for she was tired and knew she was
going to die and wanted to he described how he labored with her and
convinced her and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to
where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight how he pushed his way
out at the hole and then helped her out how they sat there and cried
for gladness how some men came along in a skiff and tom hailed them
and told them their situation and their famished condition how the men
didnt believe the wild tale at first because said they you are
five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in then took
them aboard rowed to a house gave them supper made them rest till two
or three hours after dark and then brought them home

before day dawn judge thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
were tracked out in the cave by the twine clews they had strung behind
them and informed of the great news

three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to
be shaken off at once as tom and becky soon discovered they were
bedridden all of wednesday and thursday and seemed to grow more and
more tired and worn all the time tom got about a little on thursday
was downtown friday and nearly as whole as ever saturday but becky
did not leave her room until sunday and then she looked as if she had
passed through a wasting illness

tom learned of hucks sickness and went to see him on friday but could
not be admitted to the bedroom neither could he on saturday or sunday
he was admitted daily after that but was warned to keep still about his
adventure and introduce no exciting topic the widow douglas stayed by
to see that he obeyed at home tom learned of the cardiff hill event
also that the ragged mans body had eventually been found in the river
near the ferry landing he had been drowned while trying to escape
perhaps

about a fortnight after toms rescue from the cave he started off to
visit huck who had grown plenty strong enough now to hear exciting
talk and tom had some that would interest him he thought judge
thatchers house was on toms way and he stopped to see becky the
judge and some friends set tom to talking and some one asked him
ironically if he wouldnt like to go to the cave again tom said he
thought he wouldnt mind it the judge said

well there are others just like you tom ive not the least doubt
but we have taken care of that nobody will get lost in that cave any
more

why

because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago and
triple locked and ive got the keys

tom turned as white as a sheet

whats the matter boy here run somebody fetch a glass of water

the water was brought and thrown into toms face

ah now youre all right what was the matter with you tom

oh judge injun joes in the cave




chapter xxxiii

within a few minutes the news had spread and a dozen skiff loads of
men were on their way to mcdougals cave and the ferryboat well filled
with passengers soon followed tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore
judge thatcher

when the cave door was unlocked a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place injun joe lay stretched upon the ground
dead with his face close to the crack of the door as if his longing
eyes had been fixed to the latest moment upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside tom was touched for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered his pity was moved but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security now
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody minded outcast

injun joes bowie knife lay close by its blade broken in two the great
foundation beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through with
tedious labor useless labor too it was for the native rock formed a
sill outside it and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
no effect the only damage done was to the knife itself but if there
had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
still for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could not have
squeezed his body under the door and he knew it so he had only hacked
that place in order to be doing something in order to pass the weary
time in order to employ his tortured faculties ordinarily one could
find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this
vestibule left there by tourists but there were none now the prisoner
had searched them out and eaten them he had also contrived to catch a
few bats and these also he had eaten leaving only their claws the
poor unfortunate had starved to death in one place near at hand a
stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages builded
by the water drip from a stalactite overhead the captive had broken off
the stalagmite and upon the stump had placed a stone wherein he had
scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once
in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock tick a
dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours that drop was falling
when the pyramids were new when troy fell when the foundations of rome
were laid when christ was crucified when the conqueror created the
british empire when columbus sailed when the massacre at lexington was
news

it is falling now it will still be falling when all these things shall
have sunk down the afternoon of history and the twilight of tradition
and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion has everything a
purpose and a mission did this drop fall patiently during five thousand
years to be ready for this flitting human insects need and has it
another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come no
matter it is many and many a year since the hapless half breed scooped
out the stone to catch the priceless drops but to this day the tourist
stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow dropping water when
he comes to see the wonders of mcdougals cave injun joes cup stands
first in the list of the caverns marvels even aladdins palace
cannot rival it

injun joe was buried near the mouth of the cave and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles around they brought their children and
all sorts of provisions and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
hanging

this funeral stopped the further growth of one thing the petition to the
governor for injun joes pardon the petition had been largely signed
many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held and a committee of
sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the
governor and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty
under foot injun joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the
village but what of that if he had been satan himself there would
have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
pardon petition and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
and leaky water works

the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have
an important talk huck had learned all about toms adventure from the
welshman and the widow douglas by this time but tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told him that thing was what he wanted
to talk about now hucks face saddened he said

i know what it is you got into no and never found anything but
whiskey nobody told me it was you but i just knowed it must a ben
you soon as i heard bout that whiskey business and i knowed you
hadnt got the money becuz youd a got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody else tom somethings always
told me wed never get holt of that swag

why huck i never told on that tavern keeper you know his tavern
was all right the saturday i went to the picnic dont you remember you
was to watch there that night

oh yes why it seems bout a year ago it was that very night that i
follered injun joe to the widders

you followed him

yes but you keep mum i reckon injun joes left friends behind him and
i dont want em souring on me and doing me mean tricks if it hadnt
ben for me hed be down in texas now all right

then huck told his entire adventure in confidence to tom who had only
heard of the welshmans part of it before

well said huck presently coming back to the main question whoever
nipped the whiskey in no nipped the money too i reckon anyways
its a goner for us tom

huck that money wasnt ever in no

what huck searched his comrades face keenly tom have you got on
the track of that money again

huck its in the cave

hucks eyes blazed

the moneys in the cave

tom honest injun now is it fun or earnest

earnest huck just as earnest as ever i was in my life will you go in
there with me and help get it out

i bet i will i will if its where we can blaze our way to it and not
get lost

huck we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
world

agree to give you my drum and every thing ive got in the world i will

now but i cant walk moren a mile tom least i dont think i could

its about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go huck
but theres a mighty short cut that they dont anybody but me know
about huck ill take you right to it in a skiff ill float the skiff
down there and ill pull it back again all by myself you neednt ever
turn your hand over

less start right off tom

all right we want some bread and meat and our pipes and a little
bag or two and two or three kite strings and some of these new fangled
things they call lucifer matches i tell you manys the time i wished i
had some when i was in there before

a trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
was absent and got under way at once when they were several miles
below cave hollow tom said

now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
cave hollow no houses no wood yards bushes all alike but do you see
that white place up yonder where theres been a landslide well thats
one of my marks well get ashore now

they landed

now huck where were a standing you could touch that hole i got out
of with a fishing pole see if you can find it

huck searched all the place about and found nothing tom proudly
marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said

here you are look at it huck its the snuggest hole in this country
you just keep mum about it all along ive been wanting to be a robber
but i knew id got to have a thing like this and where to run across
it was the bother weve got it now and well keep it quiet only well
let joe harper and ben rogers in because of course theres got to be a
gang or else there wouldnt be any style about it tom sawyers gang it
sounds splendid dont it huck

well it just does tom and wholl we rob

oh most anybody waylay people thats mostly the way

and kill them

no not always hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom

whats a ransom

money you make them raise all they can offn their friends and after
youve kept them a year if it aint raised then you kill them thats
the general way only you dont kill the women you shut up the women
but you dont kill them theyre always beautiful and rich and awfully
scared you take their watches and things but you always take your hat
off and talk polite they aint anybody as polite as robbers youll see
that in any book well the women get to loving you and after theyve
been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that
you couldnt get them to leave if you drove them out theyd turn right
around and come back its so in all the books

why its real bully tom i believe its bettern to be a pirate

yes its better in some ways because its close to home and circuses
and all that

by this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole tom in
the lead they toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel then
made their spliced kite strings fast and moved on a few steps brought
them to the spring and tom felt a shudder quiver all through him
he showed huck the fragment of candle wick perched on a lump of clay
against the wall and described how he and becky had watched the flame
struggle and expire

the boys began to quiet down to whispers now for the stillness and
gloom of the place oppressed their spirits they went on and presently
entered and followed toms other corridor until they reached the
jumping off place the candles revealed the fact that it was not
really a precipice but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
high tom whispered

now ill show you something huck

he held his candle aloft and said

look as far around the corner as you can do you see that there on the
big rock over yonder done with candle smoke

tom its a cross

now wheres your number two under the cross hey right yonders
where i saw injun joe poke up his candle huck

huck stared at the mystic sign awhile and then said with a shaky voice

tom less git out of here

what and leave the treasure

yes leave it injun joes ghost is round about there certain

no it aint huck no it aint it would hant the place where he
died away out at the mouth of the cave five mile from here

no tom it wouldnt it would hang round the money i know the ways of
ghosts and so do you

tom began to fear that huck was right mis givings gathered in his mind
but presently an idea occurred to him

lookyhere huck what fools were making of ourselves injun joes
ghost aint a going to come around where theres a cross

the point was well taken it had its effect

tom i didnt think of that but thats so its luck for us that
cross is i reckon well climb down there and have a hunt for that box

tom went first cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended
huck followed four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
great rock stood in the boys examined three of them with no result
they found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock with
a pallet of blankets spread down in it also an old suspender some
bacon rind and the well gnawed bones of two or three fowls but there
was no moneybox the lads searched and researched this place but in
vain tom said

he said under the cross well this comes nearest to being under the
cross it cant be under the rock itself because that sets solid on the
ground

they searched everywhere once more and then sat down discouraged huck
could suggest nothing by and by tom said

lookyhere huck theres footprints and some candle grease on the clay
about one side of this rock but not on the other sides now whats
that for i bet you the money is under the rock im going to dig in
the clay

that aint no bad notion tom said huck with animation

toms real barlow was out at once and he had not dug four inches
before he struck wood

hey huck you hear that

huck began to dig and scratch now some boards were soon uncovered and
removed they had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock
tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he
could but said he could not see to the end of the rift he proposed
to explore he stooped and passed under the narrow way descended
gradually he followed its winding course first to the right then to
the left huck at his heels tom turned a short curve by and by and
exclaimed

my goodness huck lookyhere

it was the treasure box sure enough occupying a snug little cavern
along with an empty powder keg a couple of guns in leather cases two
or three pairs of old moccasins a leather belt and some other rubbish
well soaked with the water drip

got it at last said huck ploughing among the tarnished coins with
his hand my but were rich tom

huck i always reckoned wed get it its just too good to believe but
we have got it sure say lets not fool around here lets snake it
out lemme see if i can lift the box

it weighed about fifty pounds tom could lift it after an awkward
fashion but could not carry it conveniently

i thought so he said they carried it like it was heavy that day
at the hanted house i noticed that i reckon i was right to think of
fetching the little bags along

the money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
rock

now less fetch the guns and things said huck

no huck leave them there theyre just the tricks to have when we
go to robbing well keep them there all the time and well hold our
orgies there too its an awful snug place for orgies

what orgies

i dono but robbers always have orgies and of course weve got to
have them too come along huck weve been in here a long time its
getting late i reckon im hungry too well eat and smoke when we get
to the skiff

they presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes looked warily
out found the coast clear and were soon lunching and smoking in the
skiff as the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
under way tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight chatting
cheerily with huck and landed shortly after dark

now huck said tom well hide the money in the loft of the widows
woodshed and ill come up in the morning and well count it and divide
and then well hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be
safe just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till i run and hook
benny taylors little wagon i wont be gone a minute

he disappeared and presently returned with the wagon put the two small
sacks into it threw some old rags on top of them and started off
dragging his cargo behind him when the boys reached the welshmans
house they stopped to rest just as they were about to move on the
welshman stepped out and said

hallo whos that

huck and tom sawyer

good come along with me boys you are keeping everybody waiting
here hurry up trot ahead ill haul the wagon for you why its not as
light as it might be got bricks in it or old metal

old metal said tom

i judged so the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
more time hunting up six bits worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
than they would to make twice the money at regular work but thats
human nature hurry along hurry along

the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about

never mind youll see when we get to the widow douglas

huck said with some apprehension for he was long used to being falsely
accused

mr jones we havent been doing nothing

the welshman laughed

well i dont know huck my boy i dont know about that aint you
and the widow good friends

yes well shes ben good friends to me anyway

all right then what do you want to be afraid for

this question was not entirely answered in hucks slow mind before he
found himself pushed along with tom into mrs douglas drawing room
mr jones left the wagon near the door and followed

the place was grandly lighted and everybody that was of any consequence
in the village was there the thatchers were there the harpers the
rogerses aunt polly sid mary the minister the editor and a great
many more and all dressed in their best the widow received the boys
as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings they
were covered with clay and candle grease aunt polly blushed crimson
with humiliation and frowned and shook her head at tom nobody suffered
half as much as the two boys did however mr jones said

tom wasnt at home yet so i gave him up but i stumbled on him and
huck right at my door and so i just brought them along in a hurry

and you did just right said the widow come with me boys

she took them to a bedchamber and said

now wash and dress yourselves here are two new suits of
clothes shirts socks everything complete theyre hucks no no
thanks huck mr jones bought one and i the other but theyll fit both
of you get into them well wait come down when you are slicked up
enough

then she left




chapter xxxiv

huck said tom we can slope if we can find a rope the window aint
high from the ground

shucks what do you want to slope for

well i aint used to that kind of a crowd i cant stand it i aint
going down there tom

oh bother it aint anything i dont mind it a bit ill take care of
you

sid appeared

tom said he auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon mary
got your sunday clothes ready and everybodys been fretting about you
say aint this grease and clay on your clothes

now mr siddy you jist tend to your own business whats all this
blowout about anyway

its one of the widows parties that shes always having this time
its for the welshman and his sons on account of that scrape they
helped her out of the other night and say i can tell you something if
you want to know

well what

why old mr jones is going to try to spring something on the people
here tonight but i overheard him tell auntie today about it as a
secret but i reckon its not much of a secret now everybody knows the
widow too for all she tries to let on she dont mr jones was bound
huck should be here couldnt get along with his grand secret without
huck you know

secret about what sid

about huck tracking the robbers to the widows i reckon mr jones was
going to make a grand time over his surprise but i bet you it will drop
pretty flat

sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way

sid was it you that told

oh never mind who it was somebody told thats enough

sid theres only one person in this town mean enough to do that and
thats you if you had been in hucks place youd a sneaked down the
hill and never told anybody on the robbers you cant do any but mean
things and you cant bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones
there no thanks as the widow says and tom cuffed sids ears and helped
him to the door with several kicks now go and tell auntie if you
dare and tomorrow youll catch it

some minutes later the widows guests were at the supper table and a
dozen children were propped up at little side tables in the same room
after the fashion of that country and that day at the proper time mr
jones made his little speech in which he thanked the widow for the
honor she was doing himself and his sons but said that there was
another person whose modesty

and so forth and so on he sprung his secret about hucks share in
the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of but the
surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances however
the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment and heaped so many
compliments and so much gratitude upon huck that he almost forgot
the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybodys gaze
and everybodys laudations

the widow said she meant to give huck a home under her roof and have him
educated and that when she could spare the money she would start him in
business in a modest way toms chance was come he said

huck dont need it hucks rich

nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke but
the silence was a little awkward tom broke it

hucks got money maybe you dont believe it but hes got lots of it
oh you neednt smile i reckon i can show you you just wait a minute

tom ran out of doors the company looked at each other with a perplexed
interest and inquiringly at huck who was tongue tied

sid what ails tom said aunt polly he well there aint ever any
making of that boy out i never

tom entered struggling with the weight of his sacks and aunt polly
did not finish her sentence tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
table and said

there what did i tell you half of its hucks and half of its mine

the spectacle took the general breath away all gazed nobody spoke for
a moment then there was a unanimous call for an explanation tom said
he could furnish it and he did the tale was long but brimful of
interest there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
charm of its flow when he had finished mr jones said

i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion but it
dont amount to anything now this one makes it sing mighty small im
willing to allow

the money was counted the sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
dollars it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
before though several persons were there who were worth considerably
more than that in property




chapter xxxv

the reader may rest satisfied that toms and hucks windfall made a
mighty stir in the poor little village of st petersburg so vast a
sum all in actual cash seemed next to incredible it was talked
about gloated over glorified until the reason of many of the citizens
tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement every haunted
house in st petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected
plank by plank and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden
treasure and not by boys but men pretty grave unromantic men too
some of them wherever tom and huck appeared they were courted admired
stared at the boys were not able to remember that their remarks had
possessed weight before but now their sayings were treasured and
repeated everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as
remarkable they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying
commonplace things moreover their past history was raked up and
discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality the village paper
published biographical sketches of the boys

the widow douglas put hucks money out at six per cent and judge
thatcher did the same with toms at aunt pollys request each lad had
an income now that was simply prodigious a dollar for every weekday in
the year and half of the sundays it was just what the minister got no
it was what he was promised he generally couldnt collect it a dollar
and a quarter a week would board lodge and school a boy in those old
simple days and clothe him and wash him too for that matter

judge thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom he said that no
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave when
becky told her father in strict confidence how tom had taken her
whipping at school the judge was visibly moved and when she pleaded
grace for the mighty lie which tom had told in order to shift that
whipping from her shoulders to his own the judge said with a fine
outburst that it was a noble a generous a magnanimous lie a lie that
was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to
breast with george washingtons lauded truth about the hatchet becky
thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that she went straight
off and told tom about it

judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
day he said he meant to look to it that tom should be admitted to the
national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school
in the country in order that he might be ready for either career or
both

huck finns wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow douglas
protection introduced him into society no dragged him into it hurled
him into it and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear the
widows servants kept him clean and neat combed and brushed and they
bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot
or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend he had
to eat with a knife and fork he had to use napkin cup and plate
he had to learn his book he had to go to church he had to talk so
properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth whithersoever he
turned the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him
hand and foot

he bravely bore his miseries three weeks and then one day turned up
missing for forty eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
great distress the public were profoundly concerned they searched high
and low they dragged the river for his body early the third morning
tom sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind
the abandoned slaughter house and in one of them he found the refugee
huck had slept there he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and
ends of food and was lying off now in comfort with his pipe he was
unkempt uncombed and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made
him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy tom routed him
out told him the trouble he had been causing and urged him to go home
hucks face lost its tranquil content and took a melancholy cast he
said

dont talk about it tom ive tried it and it dont work it dont
work tom it aint for me i aint used to it the widders good to me
and friendly but i cant stand them ways she makes me get up just
at the same time every morning she makes me wash they comb me all

huck i wouldnt want to and i dont want to but what would people

said

pirating ill stick to the widder till i rot tom and if i git to be
a reglar ripper of a robber and everybody talking bout it i reckon
shell be proud she snaked me in out of the wet

conclusion

so endeth this chronicle it being strictly a history of a boy it
must stop here the story could not go much further without becoming the
history of a man when one writes a novel about grown people he knows
exactly where to stop that is with a marriage but when he writes of
juveniles he must stop where he best can

most of the characters that perform in this book still live and are
prosperous and happy some day it may seem worth while to take up the
story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they
turned out to be therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that
part of their lives at present
